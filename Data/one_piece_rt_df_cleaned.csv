2026-12-06,Best Anime Live Action Adaptation of All Time. NOTHING WILL EVER BEAT ONE PIECE LIVE ACTION!,0.6696,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-11-30,How were they able to cram so much cringe into one season of television? It’s almost impressive. Almost.,0.4601,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-10-27,One Piece is an incredibly well done show. It takes a very well written storyline and based off of a manga series with an extensive following. One Piece brings manga into live action which really opens up its potential to connect with a large audience base. I was collecting One Piece trading cards then learned about the Netflix series. This series is something I watched and rewatched due to the wonderful lessons throughout the story. This show is wholistic and good in every way possible. One Piece is not a show I would have normally watched but it was so well done that I rewatch it to the level of Harry Potter or Pirates of the Caribbean. It’s just a fantastic whatch and had wonderful life lessons. I would like to see more than 8 episodes in between series releases. It’s not enough content to watch while anticipating the following season being made. One of my very favorite shows.,0.9817,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-09-30,i am not a one piece fan. but this live action made mme consider rethinkkking that. it was really good from the actingto the special effects.,0.8587,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-09-26,"I usually avoid writing reviews before watching the whole thing, however i decided to write a review of one piece after watching six episodes. This is without a doubt one of the best films i have watched. I love it. And i have never watched the original cartoon. It's a meaningful movie and fun to watch.",0.9177,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2026-09-04,"Having never seen the anime or read the manga, I went into One Piece blind and wasn't just pleasantly surprised, but completely blown away by how energetic, rousing, heartfelt and fun this series is!",0.9078,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-08-17,A amazing live action remake of one piece,0.5859,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-08-13,"Poxa que série incrível, a adaptação do anime ao live action é necessária e as vezes melhor tipo o arco do buggy, eles mantém a essência, o carisma a profundidade de um jeito quase perfeito só não do 5 estrelas por causa do episódio 3, e 4 que infelizmente são fraco mas o resto ABSOLUTE SÉRIE",0.0,Neutral,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-08-13,"I mean sure u can say they did good making a real versjon of one piece, considering the original is a anime, but then again, for me who loves the anime, I couldn't even see to episode's, because they changed up the story line, I mean sure u can't make it exactly like the anime that would be impossible, but at least try to get the story line correct, and introduce character's in the right order, Garp isn't supposed to be announced as Luffy's grandfather until he has 7 members of he's Crue, and it happens when Carp smacks Luffy's head in the floor fore sleeping, and it happens in front of his crew, that's when we the audience learn along whit his crew that his Luffy's grandfather, that's just one of the important moments, Netflix changed in the ""real"" version of One Piece",0.9493,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-08-11,"one piece has always been awful: it's an exercise in quantity over quality and ive never found it endearing past the first couple of episodes of season 1, which are still heavily flawed. i dont know who decided anyone wanted yet another live action anime adaptation, but this is one of the worst and most generic choices for source material possible and it's just as much of a disappointment as the majority of the anime is. of course this gets renewed for multiple seasons while decent products get canned left and right.",-0.9343,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-08-10,"I had never heard of One Piece before my friend made me watch this. And I ended up enjoying myself so much that I started the anime. I love the cast, directing and overall feel of the show but what stands out to me especially is the use of practical sets. Personally there is nothing worse than watching a scene and it being obvious that the actor is stood in front of a green screen. This show avoids this issue as it uses practical sets which look great, add to the atmosphere, and truly make you feel like you're part of the world. Small pieces such as the bounty posters popping up on the screen just serve to amplify your immersion and enjoyment. All of the cast embody their roles, with my personal favourite being Emily Rudd as Nami, as she portrays all aspects of her perfectly. Excited to see how they bring the following arcs to live action",0.9889,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-08-04,"In fact, an adaptation that gave me pleasure to watch, despite the difficult mission, Iñaki Godoy brings the essence of Luffy very well, making us fall in love with the character in each scene.",0.9082,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-07-18,Totally love this series. I hope there is a 2nd and 3rd season. I want to see the All Blue and the Grand Line.,0.8932,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-07-13,"It's not terrible but honestly One Piece is just one of those anime series that can never be translated perfectly into a live action show. The writing and dialogue in One Piece is so unique and nuanced that when it's made into a live action it just feels so cringe, like a middle school play. It was the same thing when they made the ATLA live action series. Sub par casting and cringy dialogue. The CGI and effects are good though. Then again we are in 2025 so it kinda has to be. Anyway, not a bad show but definitely skips over a lot of stuff. Such is the downside of live action adaptations I guess.",0.8572,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-06-30,"One Piece live-action is a surprisingly faithful and thrilling adaptation. It captures the spirit, humor, and heart of the anime while bringing fresh energy to the characters. The casting feels spot-on, and the action sequences are exciting without losing the charm that made the original beloved. It’s a great entry point for newcomers and a treat for longtime fans.",0.9863,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2026-06-19,"Retains so much of the magic of the original anime and manga, along with adding some perfect castings and world building. I'm so excited for season 2!",0.8558,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-06-15,"This obviosuly was not made for me... but even with that said, I have never seen anything even remotely this bad in my life. Worse than Life Aquatic, worse than S08 of GOT, worse than Snow White 2025. This is truly the worst thing I have ever seen in my entire life. Maybe a young kid, at best, this would be moderately entertaining for. But even then, I would never have my child watch. This is brain-dead nonsense.",-0.9417,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-06-01,"The Netflix live-action adaptation of ""One Piece"" is generally well-received, with many praising its ability to capture the essence of the original anime while adapting it for a new audience. Critics and viewers appreciate its fun, adventurous tone, strong casting, and impressive world-building, particularly with the set designs and visual effects. However, some feel the show loses some of the original's spark and ingenuity in its simplified adaptation.",0.9612,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-05-17,I think it was done very well about friendships and believing in your dream and a lot of luck. The world setting was good. I like the twist of the movie being a little animated with the settings and customs.,0.9281,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2026-05-14,"A lot of it has the vibe of a fanmade project. Some of the casting choices are good and some aren't, but the main issue is how a lot of the characters are out of... character. Some of the changes are interesting and some are unnecessary. An alright adaptation, but misses the mark in what makes One Piece what it is",0.6858,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2026-01-23,"I absolutely love that Mackenyu plays Zorro! The overall story stays true to the anime, though, of course, we can’t expect it to be identical. The CGI, special effects, costumes, and makeup are all top-notch. As for the characters, their performances are fantastic. I really can’t say much more—it’s been such an exciting ride! Now, I’m counting down the days until Season 2 arrives—please, come soon!",0.9621,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2025-01-19,"This live-action drama is absolutely phenomenal! The staging, combined with breathtaking CGI and stunning animation, creates a visually captivating experience. Each actor delivers a compelling performance, bringing their characters to life in a way that is both engaging and memorable. Mackenyu's portrayal stands out—his charisma and talent are simply unmatched! I'm completely hooked and eagerly anticipating Season 2. I hope it arrives soon—it's impossible to wait!",0.9592,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2025-01-06,I was excited for it but it was disappointing. Everyone did a great job except inkai. His acting is terrible and cringy. The CGI used for stretching scenes is really bad. From the source material they butchered the story lines.,-0.8068,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes
2024-12-05,"I hate a lot of things and the first season of this show surprised me so much with how well it's made. I'd definitely recommend it and truly hope it gets better in future seasons instead of most shows getting worse with every additional season, and getting rid of the writes and teams who worked to make the show good to begin with!",0.9007,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2024-11-20,"As a fan of Mr. Eiichiro Oda's work, it's a great adaptation! Both the world and the cast; it's a great achievement by the production team. This first season is a good start to open doors and invite a more diverse audience for both young people and adults who don't like watching cartoons. And I'm more than excited to see more of this adaptation. 👏",0.9419,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2024-10-19,"I've been fan of one piece since the beginning, and it's actually quite nice to watch. Purists will say this is an ignominy, but when you take it as a simple show and don't expect it to be a copy of copy then it's nice to watch It's worth watching, even just for your knowledge.",0.8292,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2024-09-27,"Once upon a time I was one of the fierce enjoyers of the anime One Piece. I stopped watching the anime not because I didn't like it or it was boring...not at all! Watching the show made me wanna go back and rewatch the entire anime from scratch because of the nostalgia I felt with this live action. It is my sincere opinion that they managed to deliver a super accurate version of the OG and they magically nailed every little detail that makes One Piece a great story. From the cast to the cinematography, this show was one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. Of course there are always limitations from adapting an anime/cartoon into a live action, but honestly....I didn't even notice any. Thank you Netflix and thank you people behind this amazing show. THIS is GOOD entertainment, THIS is how FANTASTIC adaptations are made and THIS is RESPECTING a story of a life time that has and still is influencing so many people arround the world. Very well done!",0.9936,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2024-09-08,"I've been a fan of One Piece since 2010 and to watch this thing was half sad/half painful . THE GOOD PARTS: The cast. Really like the actors. They're an awesome match. I've got suspicions about Zoro and Sanji at first, but the whole crew is so cute. Buggy and Koby are unbelievably real :) The visualisation is pretty good too. It was difficult to believe that it is possible to film such a crazy world as One Piece, but they've done it, and done it not bad. Respect to artists, animators and the whole art department. BAD SIDES. The script, the whole writing of the dialogues and story. It was just painful and sad to watch how such a great story and characters were twisted most of the time to 180 degree. And there's no point in saying 'it's not an anime but a series, they had to cut the narration '. Because half of the first season is a stupid story of the relationship between grandfather/grandson and the whole story about Coby and talks about pirates can be good/evil. Garp must not appear for at least three seasons! And here he suddenly became the main star of the show. Delete this out-of-blue-trash and you have a lot of time for the real story. They created a random non-existent story and deleted, killed characters that never were killed(Merry) and completely ignored important characters like Hachi. They wasted money on building Garp’s ship (that never existed here) but didn't bother to waste money on octopus that will play the main role in the future plot-twist. It was just so out of line and completely opposite of the real One Piece. Luffy making plans the night before and sitting near the bad of wounded Zoro - 180° of what he did in the Real One Piece; pretending that he is not a pirate(!), but a bounty hunter; Zoro who is not loyal to his captain; a fearless karate warrior Nami; quiet cute Ussop; Sanji who for a request of a girl said 'NO'!? It was just painful. Really. I love to watch actors on Instagram, but Netflix's policies and religions made a trash from the most awesome story in the world. In fact it's kinda incredible how they can do it that well even with the best story.... CONCLUSION: Don't waste your time and just watch/read the original",0.979,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2024-08-24,"Pas parfait, mais je recommande, car c'est une autre vision de l'œuvre avec un côté plus mature (peut-être trop avec dark Sasuke Zoro) J'étais dubitatif sur les pouvoirs ect mais ça, c'est amélioré avec le temps. À voir comment ça continue.",0.5859,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2024-07-19,This live action adaptation absolutely crushes it.

2024-06-20,"I have seen One Piece (live action) twice and I was never bored either time. The actors/actresses play their roles outstandingly and I think Eiichiro Oda did a great job making One Piece come to life. Although thought there were a few details that were left out, like Usopp's long nose or Luffy's sandals, I think they couldn't have done better. The scenery was beautifully done, and the special effects were everything. I would recommend One Piece to anyone, live action or not.",0.946,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2024-06-20,I really enjoyed this series and watched it in 1-2 days. But I have to say this was the first time I watched One Piece so I can't tell you anything about how good it was realised from the anime. I wish there wehre more episodes ;D,0.9248,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2024-06-19,"I had my doubts about this live-action adaptation of the No. 1 manga/anime nowadays, but I need to say that this adaptation has been made by people who understand what One Piece means to the fans.

2024-04-30,"I am a big fan of the anime and the manga, and to me, the series was so rushed. Eight episodes are not enough at all to introduce the characters, show how they created a bond, and adapt the whole East Blue Saga. I mean, I don't care about how they changed the storyline if the nature of the characters is the same. Contrary, it could be refreshing if you know every little detail even in your sleep, but they should have left some screen time for proper development. My problem is that the cast is terrific. Plus the cinematology and the music are also perfect. So I don't know how to feel about it at all.",0.7897,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2024-02-12,"Coming into the show as a long time fan of the original manga and the anime, I just want to give credits to the casts. From our main Straw Hats, Inaki, Emily, Mackenyu, Taz and Jacob, to the amazing Arlong (Mckinley Belcher III), Buggy (Jeff Ward), Mihawk (Steven Ward), to Helmeppo (Aidan Scott) and Koby (Morgan Davies). They handled each role carefully and deliver the core of each characters, some are indeed stellar in comparison but none of them bringing the series down. In the era where actors who play roles in live-action making blunders during press tours, they came out well and very respectful. Eiichiro Oda involvement definitely the main point why this show works, with showrunners who actually understand the show materials. The production team, from hair and make up, to the set and the musical scores definitely did their best, glad that it shows. Is it perfect? no. It is silly, whacky, and some jokes are hit or miss, but it is fun. We all need some fun to watch in which the whole family can enjoy. As a fan, I'm not the biggest fan of the Garp switch up, but I understand why western writers feels the need to push such grit. Well, I just want to encourage people to give this show a shot because it is just a fun series to fill some weekend movie time.",0.9966,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2024-02-08,Amazing series and stunning characters!,0.7712,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2024-01-31,"My persona problem is there was a lot of good about the series, buuuut a hated Garp character. He is literally with a stick in his ass. In the anime he is laughing all the time and when is not laughing he is hitting some one, or drinking, or shout. This is a rear disorder for people in the army after a war. Either you are paranoid and think that someone is constantly trying to kill you, or the conscience and despair of what happened constantly haunts you, or you are a jovial person who has turned off other feelings and just enjoys life and especially the thrill of fighting. Garp is a crazy jolly guy who won't hesitate to kill you and his spartan training, which he takes for normal because he has post-war syndrome, is absolutely natural. Koby overacts constantly. It's like watching the Zoolander kid, one facial expression, the entire series. Chef Zeff, one of the most famous pirates of his time, gets upset when he sees Arlong and overacts in the scene with Garp. How can Kuro be a meta human and Zeff not. For Arlong They could have chosen someone bigger than an actor and Luffy wouldn't even close his eyes in fear of being bitten. It was one of the most absurd moments. The first time I saw Luffy really get scared was during the fight with Kuma if I'm not mistaken he had never freaked out like that before it was humiliating. In this scene, Arlong could have just thrown him into the sea and not taken him seriously without even realizing that he had eaten a devil fruit. Which reminds me of the scene of Luffy eating the devil fruit. I laughed so hard when in the anime Luffy steals the fruit eats it and complains that it tastes bad while eating the stolen fruit hahahaha. No, they should have cut the scene to a boring scene where he just finds a fruit eats it and that's it. No dramas no panic without his brash omnivorous behavior. It's a huge part of his character, his cheeky way of stealing other people's food, which is normal because of how he's expressed with his brothers. But what pissed me off the most was the first episode. 5 min and I was already scratching my head, what the hell is this. A flotilla of pirates, then a flotilla of Marines and no one fights, they even calmly let them watch Roger's execution. And then the pirates leave undisturbed. In the animation, the square is simply huge, and even if they wanted to, they couldn't find pirates hiding in the crowd. It would have been better if they had made a small scene with CG to make the plaza huge and also add the question ""Did you find the legendary treasure, did you find One Piece"" to make it clear that this is a legendary treasure and not just Roger's legacy. Nah, they better leave out one of the most important elements of the whole story. What was the name of this series adaptation? They Americanized it, and it pissed me off from the first episode. But if someone can refute me that my arguments are not correct, I dare!Also while reading the comments I thought of one more note. One Piece is one of the funniest series I've ever watched and I still watch it with over 1000 episodes and at least 500 of them I've watched 2 times because it makes me laugh out loud. In the adaptation, this is simply not there",-0.6261,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes
2024-01-28,"I had high hopes for this adaptation to be better. Dear Mister Matt Owens, thank you for this series. Dear Mister Eiichiro Oda, thank you for creating One Piece. Luffy is brazillian like me, and i love it. Inaki was a perfect casting, he is the REAL LIFE Luffy! For now i can't wait to see the second season. Espcially Chooper! :D",0.985,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2024-01-21,"I love anime, but never much cared for the One Piece cartoon. However this live action version is awesome, even my father likes it. I'd recommend this to anyone, not just anime lovers. Give it a watch, you likely won't regret it.",0.9106,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2024-01-17,"This is kids-only fare. Or if you really really love hand-to-hand battle sequences. We were looking for something silly and fun. Happy to overlook flaws and go with whatever works in a series. But we could barely survive the first chapter. So many tropes, executed in such a rushed cliche-d manner. It felt like the 1 minute video introduction to a computer game. So much stupidity, especially plot-wise. Such a lack of internal consistency. Couldn't take it. Could see hints of what people like: some good acting, the inappropriate ways the lead character uses his smile, the scenes from the lead's childhood worked.",0.8976,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-12-25,"Las adaptaciones de anime hechas por EUA muchas veces no han sido del todo bien recibidas, pero en este caso parece que decidieron seguir el ejemplo del cine japonés que ha hecho adaptaciones más aferradas al material original. La serie One Piece es una estupenda serie de aventuras que, según muchos testimonios, logra replicar la visión del material original. De las adaptaciones que ha hecho Hollywood, solo las de Ghost In The Shell, Battle Angel Alita, Detective Pikachu y Speed Racer lograron replicar o acercarse a la visión del material original. Se podría decir que One Piece es una gran mejora, pero eso gracias a ciertos elementos que se tuvieron en cuenta. El autor original del manga estuvo involucrado en la creación de la serie, lo cual eso fue un factor importante. En el caso de One Piece, no era necesario que todos los actores fueran japoneses. Según las declaraciones de Eiichirō Oda, los personajes son de distintas nacionalidades y los actores escogidos para interpretar a los personajes tienen características físicas que cumplen esos requisitos. Además, las historias de piratas siempre han tenido una popularidad en el continente Europeo, aunque son algo a nivel mundial y es algo que se vio incluso reflejado en la tercera película de Piratas Del Caribe. One Piece es una historia de piratas que no se limita a los aspectos europeos de este tipo de historias, sino que también se extiende a nivel mundial, presentando varios personajes que claramente provienen de distintas naciones. La serie sé lucio bastante con la producción, el vestuario y los efectos especiales que adaptan el mundo del manga al mundo real. Con tan solo comparar los dibujos con algunas escenas de la serie, es evidente que respetaron bastante el material original. La primera temporada es solo una introducción de la serie que nos va presentando a los protagonistas Luffy, Nami, Zoro, Usopp y Sanji. Se centra en sus motivaciones, ofrece un vistazo a eventos de la infancia que los marcaron y muestra como se van desarrollando como equipo. La serie empieza bastante bien ofreciendo una muy buena introducción a las aventuras de Luffy y sus amigos en la búsqueda por el One Piece. Mi calificación final para esta temporada es un 9/10.",0.5859,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-12-21,"Good series, with great characters and perfect cast. The child actors looked very similar to their adult versions. The beginning of the season is a little slow, but halfway through it gets more exciting. The level of visual fidelity to the manga was surprising.

You don't know what to expect in the next scene, characters are well written and awesome, the feel of adventure...

2023-11-29,"It's a sign of how terrible US TV properties are lately that the best shows are from somewhere else - Japan and South Korea (with some Australia and China in there too) in particular. Shows from places other than the US (or UK) have a daring, a creativity that has simply been corporatized to death in the US. ""One Piece"" is such a show. It's based on a long-running comic, and then an anime series, and now a live-action -- which has *not* been beaten flat by Netflix (cheers, Netflix!) Its a bizarre, funny, and entertaining mix of all kinds of stuff, with an energy that is just ensnaring. Give it a try!",0.9172,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-11-11,"Have to give this 5 stars. Started watching because of all the good reviews. Don't know anything about the anime so going in blind. I think its main target audience is for kids, but once you get past the kid elements there are actually some surprisingly well done universal human elements that should appeal to everyone. It's a pretty far out story that stretches the imagination and it could easily have turned into a shallow caricature sort of show. It surfs the fine line very well between substance and surface, which is very hard to pull off but I think essential as an anime adaptation. The end result is something that is very entertaining that also carries some heart warming themes. It could easily have been one of the worse shows ever, but thankfully it is shaping up to be one of the best anime adaptations ever.",0.9895,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-11-11,"I'm probably the only person who binged this who knew nothing about the manga or the animated series or literally anything about it aside from the covert art on Netflix.

2023-11-06,"Being a fan of both the manga and the anime, was looking forward to the TV series but with uncertainty, let's face it, anime just don't do well as live-action adaptation. Well, I was presently surprised, everything was perfect for the fans of the original work, be it the casting, story adaptation, action sequence or the flow of the storytelling. Still, those coming to this feel-good fantasy series for the first time may find it to be too kiddish.",0.853,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-11-05,"What Can I say this is by far the best executed Anime to real life adaptation I have ever seen. My only true complaint is how short each arc is but I understand that Netflix done this because it was taking a risk and shows nowadays dont have 24+ episodes per season. The writers respected the story and stayed as true to it as they could for each arc of the story. Somethings were cut I understand due to the time constraint of episodeds but in my opinion they captured the true essence of the anime. The actors played there rolls perfectly I cant complain about it. Some may complain the set looks cheaply done, but honestly anyone fan of the anime will likely love this show. Great work by everyone involved with this show! Cant wait for the next season.",0.9907,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-11-04,"This show has no right to be as entertaining as it is, considering the corny premise. But it's easily the best Netflix manga adaptation I've seen so far. Not at least because of the cast, which is spot on. Apparently Netflix went for the best people for each part rather than famous actors or forced diversity. And it shows. They all give great performances. Can't wait for the next season Netflix. Get on with it :-)",0.9707,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-10-25,What an absolute treat! Don't let your interest or not in anime stop you from enjoying this rousing escapism. It's all heart and very much about family while also full of action and silly combat. Each of the characters gets a full backstory and character development even as the first season is only 8 episodes. It's a bit corny if you are more into serious fantasy. But the show will leave most people with a smile on their face. Very fun and can't wait for more.,0.9108,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-10-24,"A very cool live action of One Piece, even if it doesn't follow the story from the anime. It's not really for people who have nothing with this fantasy/anime theme. What I find sad, very sad is the race swaps. And I'm not taking about the main characters. They have so much heart and feeling for their roles. The drop was Nami her sister. Why must everything be swapped. Be original. This is just sad, just to get a ESG quota. It is sad. Make people their own original movies.",-0.3862,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-10-23,"Anime adaptations on Netflix or other streaming site are almost always untrue to the source material, badly written, terribly casted, or unable to bring the animation style into live action due to bad cgi or other greenscreen effects. This is not one of those adaptations! The cast fully takes on the roles of each character to the point its hard to not see the animated characters shining through. The show pays great attention to the source by having the original creator give input on how to compressing alot of the 61 episodes of season 1 of the anime into 8 episodes with only minor changes to the story. Lastly the effects/cgi will still seem odd to most people but it is done very well and plays that line between anime and live action perfectly. If Netflix and other streaming sites can follow what One Piece did they could very easily convince the original fans to watch.",0.9597,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-10-23,"Even though it's too short to cover 40+ episodes of anime, but these 8 episodes amused me more than I expected. There were some disappointing things like Usopp's appearance and shorter battles than in the anime and some missed humour opportunities, but the series did its job to show that a live action adaptation can do it right without being cringey. Just wish the series can be much longer to cover all these story arcs...after all, it's all on Netflix rather than airing on a TV channel. Looking forward to Season 2 for more of the early story arcs.",0.8201,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-10-07,"Watching the anime almost since the beginning of its release. While I do love this overall as a Live Action, I do have some things that I just don't like about it. Some of the things are as follow compared to the anime, Luffy is extremely weaker (I mean he's supposed to have monstrous superhuman strength) they either added new plot points or just got rid of them (They introduced Garp too early, Arlongs appearance at the baratie) They didn't add key characters like the fish-man hachi that gets reintroduced for the fish-man island arc. And in my opinion Most (Not all) of the fight scenes felt underwhelming. And some of the characters appearances just didn't feel right to me (like ussop not having his long nose which was part of his whole character being called ""long nose"" throughout the anime series) Still thought the One Piece Live action was pretty good, but I thought it could have been better. (Sad that it only got 8 episodes. Was hoping for more so that it could add more plot and it being a bit less condensed)",0.8481,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-10-07,"I tried watching it, and couldn't get through the first episode. It was a bit weird and hard to get myself invested. I kept hearing good things, and so I tried again. After getting used to the show's more annoying quirks, I discovered great characters with fantastic writing and character development. As the show progressed, those annoying quirks grew on me and somehow became charming in a way. The show archived a wonderful balance of humor, action, drama, and leaves you feeling uplifted and somewhat inspired. I am not familiar with the source material, but it is obvious that this show was made with love. If you HATE what has happened with the witcher, star wars, rings of power, wheel of time, etc, then I think you will be pleasantly surprised by the quality of this show; if for no other reason than they obviously appreciate their fans.

2023-10-07,"This kind of adaptation is usually a slippery slope. This series positively surprised me with its ability to convey the feelings and themes of the manga while being aware of the limitations of the live action media. It never tries to bite more that it can chew, and while some budget limitations show in VFX, the overall quirkiness and charm of the production design make up for it. Fantastic work by Godoy, who gives a strikingly spot-on interpretation of Luffy, a character that could easily become annoying but never once comes close to it here. In my opinion all the casting was spot-on and the acting was overall at good level. This production has its issues but it's a heartfelt craft and it shows.",0.9423,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-10-02,"At first, I wasn't impressed, but when I tell you it got better it did! The fight scenes were great, the sets were epic, the costume designs were awesome, and the cast did amazing! 👏 i also love how the live action chose to do season 1s pacing, as the anime made a lot of the events in the live action way more drawn out. I finished the live action in one day with my siblings, and not only did it end a good day, but I feel like it made us all aware that we have dreams we should keep chassing too, just like the Straw hats ☆ can't wait for season two! ☠️ 🏴‍☠️",0.991,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-10-01,Looks like they did a really good job adapting it to live action. The main actor is a little annoying and the caricatures of anime characters as real people is pretty weird.

2023-09-30,"Absolute passion project mostly well executed. Some editing issues with fight choreography, but the love for this manga/anime series came through loud & clear. Cast & story telling were so strong. Loyalty to the manga telling was clear to see. I hope Oda continues to stay on the project, no matter how long it takes to unfold. If anyone criticizes this live action for not being true to the anime series, they have serious personal problems. There's no way a TV audience could watch over 1000 episodes of long drawn out story lines. I don't normally say these types of things, but this One Piece live action is in the top 3 Western Live Actions and top 5 of anime live actions.",0.9706,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-29,"Live-action anime has always been a slippery slope. It wasn't because it was something nobody wanted but because it was never done well for a long time. This show has broken that streak.

2023-09-29,"A great series for anyone even people who don't like anime. This is a way more than just some live action remaster. This is a passion project with hand picked actors by the author of the manga who created the original story of one piece. The team behind this tv series respected the source material but also changed some of the material like certain fights. the sets were beautiful, the cast was amazing and truly understood their parts. The fishmen were ugly as sin but thats kind of the whole point. Are they really meant to look good? They improved the syrup village arc and captain kuro felt like a much better villain then in the anime. Jeff Ward was phenomenal as every character he played especially Buggy I can see him becoming a new William Dafoe. This movie is a great watch for anime lovers and for people that don't usually watch anime. it's so good with great moments and new scenes that were never in the original. Go watch it you won't regret it.",0.9945,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-28,"One Piece is one of the rare adaptations that truly understands its source while remaining accessible to newcomers. From the start, the series embraces its bold tone, colorful world, and unapologetic sense of fun. Even without prior knowledge of the anime or manga, the storytelling makes it easy to care about the characters and their journeys. The direction is confident and energetic, allowing the show to be playful without feeling sloppy. Monkey D. Luffy is instantly likable, driven by optimism and heart, and the supporting crew adds depth through strong chemistry and distinct personalities. Their sense of found family becomes the emotional backbone of the series. Visually, the show is vibrant and imaginative, with impressive sets, costumes, and action that bring the world to life. Most importantly, it’s fun. The series is easy to binge, endlessly entertaining, and filled with charm. It’s an adventure that pulls you in quickly and leaves you wanting more",0.9957,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-27,"Ich war richtig angenehm überrascht. Das ist wohl die beste Live-Action Verfilmung im Bereich Anime, die mir gerade einfällt.

2023-09-27,"INTRO So, I haven't said this much on social media. I have mentioned it in one or two of my Monthly reviews or in my Star Wars Visions ranking on Youtube… but I am not the biggest fan of anime. Don't get me wrong; I used to HATE anime. Now that I have grown up and matured a little, I can enjoy sitting down and getting down with an anime with friends. However, it's been a year since I accidentally stopped watching My Hero Academia Season 3 (it really is a crime. *I* would stake me through the heart). Additionally, it's been months since I have continued my journey through Black Clover (though I did binge some today while editing). The point is, I do enjoy SOME anime now, but I am not the biggest fan nor would it be my first choice in any regard. I am down, if you're down to get down with My Hero, Naruto, or Fairytale… or what have you—I need friends. ANYWAY. ONE PIECE LIVE ACTION! NETFLIX USING DADDY'S MONEY… BUT I'M NOT COMPLAINING… YET Yes, Netflix really went all out for this one like they typically do for shows they fully believe in. Like I said in my mini review (for my February Monthly review), I really do enjoy the look and production style of Netflix shows. They have a certain look and color-grading to their shows that really separates them from other streamers. Yes, most of their shows and movies are misses—sometimes colossal [I am looking at you ""Pretty Smart"" and ""Dad, You're Embarrassing Me!""]. However, every once in a while, they have hidden gems they'll pour pretty much their every talent into producing, which does include MONEYYYYYY. Which is both good and bad. If the show continues to do well, GREAT! It's profitable enough to keep going, but the more expensive it gets, the higher the risk of cancellation as people are people and there is SO Much content coming out, sometimes genuinely good things fall through the cracks. RENEWED FOR SEASON 2 We can all let out a sigh of relief, though, for One Piece because Netflix already greenlit a season 2. So, let's hope the Actor and Writer Strike (We ALWAYS stand with the talent!) can be resolved soon enough so we can get Season 2 underway. FEELS LIKE A LIVE ACTION ANIME IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY Honestly, if they made live action anime just like this one, I would watch them all. This has the perfect balance of ""anime-like"" without going over the top. They even have the classic calling out the finishing moves, the EXCITED vocal inflections, and even have anime music! Yet, never does it feel cheesy or over the top. It all felt right; it reminded me how Nia DeCosta, director for Candyman and upcoming, The Marvels, said her movie was basically going to be a ""live-action anime."" With the confirmed reshoots, it's safe to surmise they tried to de-sillify that movie a bit due to it's rumored to be only 1hr and 45 minutes. I digress, but if that movie feels and looks anything like One Piece, I will be happy. HOW ABOUT THAT BOSS FIGHT, HUH…? How to gauge this one without spoilers… hm… well… let's just say the obvious Deus Ex Machina had me quadruple talking about how and why the show went from solid writing to suddenly and insanely lame choice and twist with no previous inkling of this twist. At all. You hint at twists so that it doesn't look like you wrote yourself into a corner and needed a quick escape. I don't know about you, but I didn't like it! I hope you know what it is, if you've seen the show already. But, man, oh, man, I did not like that choice. CLOSING REMARKS The show does end on an exciting promise for more and I CANNOT wait for more, honestly! Will I watch the OG anime? HEEEEEEEEEECK, NAH. That's over 1000 episodes and that's time I don't want to spend on it, haha. I already have a huge watchlist to catch up on; adding another IMMENSE task on my already big pile would not be wise. I enjoyed my time with One Piece a LOT. I was surprised it was Pirate themed + superpowers of some kind. The show is creative with the filmmaking and the script is solid. I give One Piece a 9.5 out of 10.",0.9993,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Movement, voice and idiosyncrasies of the individual characters are well reproduced and as a viewer you get the feeling, at least I did, that you are really watching the anime or that you recognise facial expressions and actions.

2023-09-25,"I haven't seen or read any of the source material, so I am judging the show on its own merits. It's goofy and bizarre in a fun way, it stands out to me among the sci-fi and fantasy shows being pumped out at the moment as much more cohesive in terms of tone, characterisation, and visuals. The central themes of friendship, following your dreams, and actually being a nice person are pretty refreshing for a show targeted at adults (R13).

2023-09-24,"Some of the cast is great and the sets are incredible I really think they went all out on sticking to the visual appearance of the manga and anime that inspired it. But the action was lackluster for me the suspense of disbelief meter was broken for me when you have fight scenes where the person stands perfectly still as Luffy winds up a punch, and that happened throughout so many fight scenes. Season 2 which I am sure Netflix will give they need to invest in a fight coordinator or at least a better one. Secondly I get they had to cut a great deal because there is so much source material to try and follow but one or two more episodes to really develop a connection to the crew and their backstories wouldn't hurt. I still think it was entertaining and was truly blown away by the sets and think that all the young main cast have wild careers a head of them there could be improvements for season 2.",0.9674,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

All cast/performances, direction, editing, writing, score, set/production design... all just absolutely top-notch.

2023-09-22,"One of those shows where you will binge it all the way through. Really moves you in a lot of places with quite a bit of emotional depth so it really makes those few instances where they seem to drop the ball stand out so much more so. Best way to describe it is an amusement park that starts off a little slow (ie, you can tell EP 2 they gave it an injection of money) then builds up with a lot of good twist and turns, some wild rides, and that last ""round the bend"" just couldn't land and nail it on the head like the previous 80% did. It almost seems like at the end of EP 6 they remembered they had to wrap it up. There was just that one last plot point that made ZERO sense which actually had a lot to do with the story. It just takes you out of the story if, while watching it, you ask yourself ""Now why would they do that? What would have happened if they didn't?"" and realize that it's another ""forced plot point"" Hollywood seems to think we should buy without asking. This show was by far at it's best when it was able to present a story in each EP (the 1st 6 EPs) but unfortunately seemed to go astray when it felt it needed to pay heed to the ""formula"".",0.5873,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-22,"As someone who saw around 80 episodes of the anime before but was on hold, I wasn't really impressed with the first episode. The way they tried balancing the aesthetics with a lot of practical effects looked weird. It kind of reminded me of old TV shows. Adding to that some emotional scenes being cut short initially made me not so interested in it. But as more positive reviews started coming on, I decided to try it again and it was well worth it. The way this series used so much practical effects and made the aesthetics and tone work is incredible. Inaki Godoy as Luffy is the perfect casting that made me believe this world works like this. He's different from the anime yet shows the spirit of it. Obviously, there was a lot of stuff that wasn't as good as the anime. And even though it only covers under 60 episodes of anime, it mixed up some stuff that would come way later which spoiler a few stuff for me in the anime. But this made me want to watch the anime again and I restarted it. The cast has been incredible. Zoro is great, Sanji is also pretty great. Nami's actress did an incredible job of showing how she's hiding her emotions. Usopp was perfect in the sense it gave the anime feel but it wasn't as annoying. In fact, it was one of the things that worked way better than the anime. That whole syrup village story was way better even though the anime had some cool fights. Overall, this had a lot of stuff in it that actually did a better job than anime even though there are many that don't. So up until the point it covers in the anime, it's almost as good as the anime for me.",0.9933,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-19,"Having watched this on the back of numerous recommendations, I'm elated I heeded the advice. The show effortlessly blends fun with moments of deep seriousness, reflecting the dedication of both its cast and writers. The casting is simply outstanding. Initially, I anticipated disliking Luffy, but his undeniable charisma draws you in. Similarly, Nani's portrayal is commendable. Rather than being reduced to a clichéd ""girl boss"", her character radiates genuine vulnerability, making her endearing and strong. She's perceptibly sharper than Luffy but doesn't overshadow him due to his unique traits. The plot, though straightforward, resonates because of its adherence to traditional storytelling elements, devoid of the unnecessary subversions that have marred modern narratives like the recent Star Wars adaptations. The show's choreography stands out, adhering to the anime trope of starting with weaker antagonists and gradually elevating the stakes with formidable foes. Hands down, this is the finest live adaptation of an anime I've witnessed.",-0.8381,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes

This series does a great job at appealing to that nature despite having to cram so much story and complexity within just the first season.

2023-09-16,"Other than the stupidity that is gender (Black Cat Bros to one being a woman possibly not even siblings) and race swapping (Nami's adoptive sister even more egregious a black Monkey D. Luffy as a child… how does he go from being a black kid to someone born from an American father and a Mexican mother? The real character Monkey D. Luffy is Brazilian and appears while that is to say whiter than Usopp who is African but not as white as Nami who is Swedish point is Iñaki Godoy looks closer to the real Monkey D. Luffy (again Brazilian) so why have the live action character portrayed as two completely separate nationalities neither of which are correct but Iñaki Godoy looks close enough and accurately portrays the character in spirit and overall actions enough that it works in all regards… while no hate to the young actor who played M D. L as a kid and well at that it's quite jarring to see the character look so different than what they really did. Those issues aside, I actually liked this live action version more than the original anime as it's more realistic, (such is the nature of live action but done in a way that's better than 99% of them) has less of that bizarre Japanese character over-the-top weirdness that a ton of if not all anime have at least to some extent (can be a good or at lesst interesting thing if not used too over-the-top in ways that seem odd to those not from Japan or possibly even those in Japan as I never understood the reasoning behind the trope) and so, makes the characters more realistic by doing so as well as switching some things up that also makes them more likeable… all while generally keeping One Piece one piece, more or less anyway. While this can dramatically change the plot most things are better imo as the changes drop some of the bloat in favour of better plot lines that seem to have more thought put into them which are likely for various reasons (live action vs anime so perhaps given more ""serious"" reasoning behind them rather than a Japanese because ""over-the-top"" not necessarily making sense but may seem cool like America does in a different style… hard to explain but, iykyk) and I believe Eiichiro Oda had say in this version too (as it's literally based on their ip). Yet seeing as it's likely going for a more condensed version than 65+++ episodes (ie continuations, other chapters, spin offs, and such) but hopefully lasting near as long while still keeping the magic! (supposedly aiming for 6 seasons so if all are 8 episodes that's at least 48 episodes!) It does lose some of the life that added to the original such ShuShu and the old man so there is that… and I did notice some inconsistencies, perhaps even plot holes I still prefer most scenes and overall L-A show to the og anime. Overall I can't quite compare it fully to the original as I've yet to finish the og nor do I believe is this live action retelling over as it seems primed for a season two and who knows how many after that. Definitely a good way to bring people into One Piece and anime, not that it hasn't already become mainstream…",0.9957,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-13,"English language first - German afterwards -------------------------------- Season 1 - OnePiece. 8 episodes that try to capture the charm of the anime and bring it to real life. My conclusion: Yes, they did it - I watched it in German. Especially two factors play an important role. 1) The German dubbing voices from the anime were used here. This is not only good for the plot, but you can recognise the idiosyncrasies of the individual characters and awaken old memories. 2) The actors themselves. With each episode they grow more and more into their roles and give them their own profile, which in the end is what makes ""The Straw Hat Gang"" so special. Everyone is obviously having fun here in acting/ playing and therefore there is a pleasant lightness to be felt. But also the supporting roles are well cast and you get the feeling that everyone is making the most of his screentime. Another point are the different background stories of the actors. Each character gets an episode to himself, which brings calmness but also a pleasant structure to the series and season 1. Maybe not everything is perfect. Maybe some things are exaggerated. Maybe maybe maybe... of course this is a personal view. For me, season 1 fits and makes me want to watch season 2. If Netflix follow this charm, if the characters continue pushing the main story and also the individual side plots with so much ease, then I look forward to more. It's good to follow the manga as much as possible. Of course not everything is possible but they should try to do as much as possible. My opinion: Watch it and have fun. -------------------------------- Staffel 1 - Einteilig. 8 Episoden, die versuchen, den Charme des Anime einzufangen und ihn ins reale Leben zu bringen. Mein Fazit: Ja, sie haben es geschafft - ich habe es auf Deutsch gesehen. Vor allem zwei Faktoren spielen dabei eine wichtige Rolle. 1) Die deutschen Synchronstimmen aus dem Anime wurden hier verwendet. Das ist nicht nur gut für die Handlung, sondern man kann die Eigenheiten der einzelnen Charaktere erkennen und alte Erinnerungen wecken. 2) Die Schauspieler selbst. Mit jeder Folge wachsen sie mehr und mehr in ihre Rollen hinein und geben ihnen ein eigenes Profil, was ""Die Strohhutbande"" letztlich so besonders macht. Alle haben hier sichtlich Spaß am Schauspielen/Spielen und so ist eine angenehme Leichtigkeit zu spüren. Aber auch die Nebenrollen sind gut besetzt und man hat das Gefühl, dass jeder das Beste aus seiner Screentime macht. Ein weiterer Punkt sind die unterschiedlichen Hintergrundgeschichten der Schauspieler. Jeder Charakter bekommt eine Episode für sich, was Ruhe, aber auch eine angenehme Struktur in die Serie und Staffel 1 bringt. Vielleicht ist nicht alles perfekt. Vielleicht sind einige Dinge übertrieben. Vielleicht, vielleicht, vielleicht... das ist natürlich eine persönliche Ansicht. Für mich passt Staffel 1 und macht mir Lust auf Staffel 2. Wenn Netflix diesem Charme folgt, wenn die Charaktere die Haupthandlung und auch die einzelnen Nebenhandlungen weiterhin mit so viel Leichtigkeit vorantreiben, dann freue ich mich auf mehr. Es ist gut, dem Manga so weit wie möglich zu folgen. Natürlich ist nicht alles möglich, aber sie sollten versuchen, so viel wie möglich zu machen. Meine Meinung: Zuschauen und Spaß haben.",-0.9763,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-12,"This show really surprised me. Adaptations of anime are usually pretty bad. I got one episode into Cowboy Bebop before I was out. I never watched the original anime, but I could tell there was just no heart in the adaptation. With One Piece, I also never watched the original, but I know enough about anime to know that season 1 has absolutely mastered taking the ridiculous aspects of anime that make it kind of fun and embracing them, rather than casting them aside. The CGI was better than I expected (making a rubber man is not easy to make look even slightly realistic). The acting was solid. Inaki Godoy (Monkey D. Luffy) was absolutely perfect for this role. His unhinged smile and how much fun he clearly had with the character made what could have been a one-note character work so well. Mackenyu (Roronaoa Zoro) gave a great performance as a stoic samurai. Emily Rudd (Nami) was perfect as well. The showrunners fought the all too common urge nowadays to make the female character perfect. She was flawed, she was complex, she was allowed to be an interesting character. I'm not going to single out actors, but there was one character that gave a very wooden performance that often took me out of the scene, but that is a minor grievance. I watched a few episodes of the anime afterwards, and they were very respectful of the source material. It is not easy to make a good live action anime, but this fun, pirate/samurai/clown/fish-people/stretchy-man show has nailed it. I can't wait for season 2.",0.9911,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Writing is bad (as in deciding which lines to pluck from the original, which ones to add, scenes order, doing proper character development, etc.). Direction is awful overall tbh as it so clearly misses the spirit of the original series. Casting is mediocre. Acting is mediocre and that's being very generous. Pacing is just off more than half the time. And why does it feel like it's set in 2023 when it's about pirates? Time setting is a thing, guys - please at least try. But most importantly - it really, REALLY lacks the pizzazz. The grandeur. The punch. The theater! Ugh... so disappointed. I'm so glad many people like the show! I wish I felt anywhere close to that.

2023-09-11,"This practically brought me to tears of joy. I've become so disillusioned by my favourite franchises being degraded by disingenuous woke identity politics that I'd totally checked out from watching anything. But I read One Piece the manga and I thought I'd give the series a try and it has restored my faith that great series with compelling narratives and performances are still possible! It made me feel like a child again and restored that sense of adventure. I think the casting choices are spot on, I was really impressed by the adaption, the score. I can't wait for season 2!",0.9789,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-11,"One Piece é fiel ao mangá e o anime. Eu não era próximo de One Piece e está série me fez interessar mais pelo o universo. Todos os episódios são muito bons. Maioria dos dubladores da série são os mesmos do anime que da uma imersão melhor aos fãs. O Iñaki Godoy está incrível como Luffy e está muito carismático. Você tem empatia por todos os personagens, que passam por muitas dificuldades. A série fala muito sobre sonhos e como você não pode desistir deles. Cada personagem dos ""Piratas do Chapéu de Palha"" estão correndo atrás de um sonho como o Luffy que está tentando virar o Rei dos Piratas. Estou ansioso para chegada da segunda temporada.

2023-09-10,"AUTHENTIC IMMERSIVE FANTASY. I have not written many reviews, but this show encouraged me. For the first time in a decade, we get a true fantasy experience unburdened by Hollywood self-indulgent ""current day"" divisive cultural BS. The series originated in a less political era and from a less political country, and boring Hollywood finally failed to spoil genuinely wonderful IP. They have ruined Marvel. Ruined Star Wars. Ruined DC. Ruined Witcher. Ruined Star Trek. Ruined Pixar. Ruined Indiana Jones. There is nothing modern Hollywood can't seem to ruin. But they DID NOT ruin this…which makes me think this was not produced anywhere in California. The more studios leave California, the better our entertainment will be.",-0.9118,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-10,"Came into this show completely blind. Had never heard of it. Didn't know anything about it. Best show Netflix has put out in ages!!! Couldn't be any better!!!! The cast is just unbelievably talented. Kudos to Inaki Godoy as Luffy. Goofy optimism and he just nails it. Mackenyu as Zoro...his fight scenes and dry humor as just spot on. The storyline is amazing as well as the special effects. The villains are amazing and jump off the screen. Arlong, the fish pirate and Buggy the Clown and throw in Milhawk the swordsman. The show just could not be any better. 8 episodes of pure joy. My only concern is time. I am hoping they continue this series but, as with Stranger Things, time is the enemy. Luffy is a young man in this series. Apparently, he remains a young man in most of his future adventures. As we speak now, Inaki Godoy, in real life, is 20 years old. He can't portray a young man for much longer. I am hoping they will continue this series but with time running against them, I hope they just shoot a bunch of shows in a row to keep us all happy. 10 out of 10. Could not be better.",0.9441,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-10,"As a giant One Piece fan, when I heard they were making A live action adaptation I was really against the idea, but when I saw the first trailer I was really surprised at how well it looked but I still had my doubts, when I watched the first episode i was shocked, they did an amazing job. Overall I give the casting a 9/10, I give the presentation of the ships a 10/10, I give the special Effects and CGI a 9/10, and I give everything else a 10/10, I honestly hope they do a second season especially after they teased us with smoker at the end of the 8th episode.",0.9407,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

It was nice to see a cast and writers who clearly cared for the source material and didn't seek to use a beloved franchise to push their own vision. I can't wait for the next season, though I hope that they get approved for more episodes. 8 episodes was not enough. Truly a fun and genuine experience.

2023-09-10,"As a long time OP anime and manga enjoyer I was skeptical about the live action however I think the live action has a lot going for it. The general spirit embodied in the show is on par for the original anime, and that is an incredible feat for a studio taking on this challenge. All of the love and care that went into writing, directing and designing this show has without a doubt made it such a popular phenomenon. My only gripe with the show is with certain changes in the story as well as how certain characters are played by their actors. For example Garp was far too serious for the majority of the season and I feel like some of the line deliveries for Luffy could be polished slightly, just to name a few critiques. However this show pulled off something incredible and while keeping in mind that this is only the first season, I have no doubt that the show will become even more polished after its resounding success in the seasons to come, as most shows tend to improve after their debut season. TLDR; show was great notwithstanding artistic liberties, the show will likely be even better in its second season, would recommend.",0.9928,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-10,"As someone who grew up watching and reading one piece it was interesting to see the live action adaptation. I'm convinced all of these 5 star reviews are by people blinded by their love of the source material, and children under the age of 10. It just wasn't good. The acting is super corny and the costume design is incredibly cringe worthy. The goofy character designs work in the anime but not in the live action. Having most, if not all, of the background actors wearing normal looking clothes only makes the outlandish looks of the main cast stick out even more. Terrible wigs, weird fake sandal shoes that make me want to barf, corny facial hair, strange looking costume designs and an annoying main character/actor makes for an almost unwatchable tv show. It's better than any other live action anime adaptation but that is like saying something tastes better than literal poop. This feels like a block buster film that payed high schoolers to do the costume design. Think of the kid in your high school who thought it was cool to dress up like an anime character every day. That is basically what these actors look and feel like.",0.8873,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-10,"I am purely an outsider experiencing One Piece for the first time. There is obviously a difference in culture here, as this is a mess. I have questions like, are the actors told to do a poor job on purpose? Or why does this seems like a Nickelodeon kids show that has blood instead of green slime? If they are trying to match the source material, that's fine, but isn't the point of making a live action version to present the series in a different way. One star seems harsh but it is a fair reflection of how much I wanted to turn it off after the first Home Alone starring Mr. Fantastic fight. I was half expecting a paint can to come flying in.",-0.2869,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes

If you also expect ROMANCE again this isn't made for you either!!!!!! This is about family, adventure and friendship in which Oda shown in his work of One Piece!!!

I've seen people say that it's cartoonish or something but they need to understand that this is a manga and the manga is out of this world. The show runners did a great job translating it into the small screen. This was a joy to watch from start to finish. Some scenes made you cry, angry, happy and annoyed and you won't even notice that the show takes 40 to 50 minutes of your time because every time an episodes ends, you just keep wanting to watch more.

I've never seen the One Piece anime before, but this popped up over the long weekend and I thought I would give it a random watch. I am hooked !! This show made me realize what we've been missing on TV. It's so fun to watch, so entertaining; a genuine adventure! The effects, fight scenes, outfits, characters, are an addictive combination. But what really puts this show over the top is it's heart. Amazing heartwarming stories, an inspirational message, and amazing chemistry between the main characters. I was really blown away by Inaki Godoy as the lead; it took him all of 5 seconds to gain my loyalty. I LOVE his charisma, and his presence on screen is genuinely infectious and inspiring!! I totally resonate with what Zoro said in the second episode, Luffy is contagious! That being said, I have a hard time picking my favorite between the main cast, which is very rare for me. They genuinely all steal the show at times; I loved Nami's story, Zoro's perfect line delivery, and Usopp's loveable charm! I may have fallen in love with Sanji, so send help.

2023-09-08,"Overall I loved it! The things I loved: Main character and villains cast and acting level was en pointe! The graphics and special effects did justice. Great story telling, pacing and world building. The things I didn't like: -Nojiko casting was a bit distracting. Yeah I know people are all like ""wow so empowering and beautiful"" that a black actress was cast, but you can't deny that she looks nothing like the original character... so why? Smells a bit like the American ""diversity hire"" influence. Oda may have been pressured into accepting for sake of appealing to a ""modern Western audience"" -They overplayed the ""girl power"" hype a bit with Kaya's arc. I'm all for feminism and the original anime and manga certainly had a bit of it. But they kinda overdid it in the same way that Marvel and Disney tends to. I personally preferred how Kaya was portrayed in the anime. It's also a shame they killed off Merry, when in the anime/manga he is still alive and continues to support Kaya. I surmise that it wasn't girl-boss enough for Netflix to have Kaya rely on a man. -In a similar spirit to the above, I don't remember Arlong from the anime/manga having such a strong victim mentality about being fish they/them. Like it was there, but it was subtle. He was mostly a brutish gangster chasing his own interests and the way he was in the Netflix version felt a bit too virtue-signally. Anyway please don't burn me at the stake for stating this. These are just my personal opinions and if you don't agree that's fine!",0.9842,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-08,"One Piece: A Série 1ª Temporada (2023) - Uma Jornada Épica que Honra sua Origem A tão esperada adaptação em live-action do popular mangá/anime ""One Piece"" finalmente chegou às telas da Netflix, trazendo consigo uma carga de expectativas e incertezas. Os fãs, com razão, estavam ansiosos para ver como essa amada obra seria traduzida para um novo formato. Agora que a primeira temporada está disponível para o público, é hora de analisar o que funcionou, o que não funcionou e o que esta série tem a oferecer. Uma das maiores preocupações quando se trata de adaptações live-action é como elas conseguem capturar a essência e a profundidade das histórias originais. Felizmente, ""One Piece"" parece ter superado essa barreira com sucesso. A série adapta de maneira satisfatória a primeira saga do anime/mangá, proporcionando uma experiência que mantém os fãs de longa data envolvidos e, ao mesmo tempo, atrai novos espectadores para esse mundo épico. Um dos aspectos mais impressionantes da série é o seu ritmo. Em alguns momentos, o ritmo da série é até melhor do que o do anime. Os episódios mantêm um equilíbrio cuidadoso entre a ação, o drama e a exploração do mundo, mantendo o espectador sempre interessado e ansioso para ver o que acontecerá a seguir. O que realmente faz essa adaptação brilhar é a disposição de abraçar a excentricidade do material original. Ao contrário de outras adaptações live-action que muitas vezes tentam suavizar ou modernizar demais os elementos fantásticos, ""One Piece"" abraça a loucura de seu mundo. Isso não apenas proporciona uma onda de nostalgia para os fãs, mas também cria um visual impressionante para os recém-chegados. Os figurinos são bem elaborados, não parecendo amadores ou meros cosplays. Os efeitos visuais também são convincentes, tornando esse mundo vibrante e realista. A direção da série é, sem dúvida, um dos seus pontos fortes. Ao longo da temporada, os diretores conseguem imergir o espectador nos combates, no drama e na construção desse mundo vasto e fascinante. A fotografia oferece quadros visualmente impressionantes, enquanto a ambientação consegue transmitir a atmosfera única e diversificada de One Piece. O elenco de ""One Piece: A Série 1ª Temporada"" desempenha um papel fundamental no sucesso da adaptação live-action. É difícil superestimar o quão importante é ter um ator talentoso para interpretar o personagem principal de ""One Piece"". Luffy é um protagonista complexo, com uma personalidade excêntrica e impulsiva, mas também com um coração de ouro. Iñaki Godoy captura a essência desse personagem de forma brilhante. Seu sorriso característico é contagiante, e sua habilidade de transmitir a inocência e a determinação de Luffy é notável. Ele se entrega ao papel com maestria, tornando Luffy um personagem carismático e engraçado, exatamente como os fãs esperavam. No entanto, nem todas as atuações atingem o mesmo nível de excelência. Mackenyu Arata, que interpreta Roronoa Zoro, deixa um pouco a desejar em sua atuação. Zoro é um personagem amado pelos fãs por sua personalidade forte e sua habilidade com a espada. Infelizmente, a interpretação de Arata não conseguiu capturar totalmente o carisma e a profundidade desse personagem. Isso pode ser devido a escolhas criativas ou a outros fatores, mas é uma área em que a série poderia melhorar em futuras temporadas. Uma das maiores surpresas e destaques brilhantes do elenco de ""One Piece: A Série"" para mim é, sem dúvida, a interpretação magistral de Vincent Regan como Vice-Almirante Garp. Sua atuação magistral e sua habilidade em transmitir a complexidade e a marra do personagem contribuem significativamente para a qualidade geral da adaptação. Em muitos momentos, é difícil não torcer mais por Garp e seus ""Marines"" do que por outros personagens, demonstrando o impacto e o carisma que ele traz para a história. Suas interações com Luffy são verdadeiramente memoráveis e empolgantes. A épica surra que ele inflige no protagonista é um dos momentos mais intensos e impactantes da temporada. Regan consegue transmitir a intensidade desse confronto de maneira impressionante, adicionando uma camada de profundidade à narrativa e tornando os espectadores ansiosos para ver como essa relação se desenrolará no futuro. É importante lembrar que, como em qualquer adaptação, algumas decisões criativas podem não agradar a todos os fãs. Um desses momentos notáveis em ""One Piece: A Série 1ª Temporada"" é a redução ou simplificação de partes da obra original, como o arco de Usopp e Kaya. Para os fãs mais dedicados da série, isso pode ter deixado um gosto vazio, já que esses arcos são queridos e têm significado na história. No entanto, é crucial compreender que essas são escolhas compreensíveis que a adaptação teve que fazer para acomodar o formato da série de televisão. Adaptações para live-action muitas vezes enfrentam limitações de tempo e orçamento, o que pode exigir a simplificação ou a eliminação de certos elementos da história. Embora isso possa decepcionar alguns fãs que desejavam uma reprodução exata da obra original, é importante reconhecer que essas mudanças não são catastróficas e não comprometem o cerne da narrativa de ""One Piece"". A série ainda consegue capturar o espírito e a essência da jornada de Luffy e sua tripulação. Por último, mas definitivamente não menos importante, a trilha sonora de ""One Piece: A Série 1ª Temporada"" merece elogios. Sonya Belousova & Giona Ostinelli fizeram um trabalho excepcional ao criar uma identidade musical única e marcante para a série. A primeira faixa, ""Wealth Fame Power"", que abre o primeiro episódio, é um exemplo perfeito de como a música pode estabelecer o tom e a atmosfera de uma narrativa. A trilha sonora não apenas complementa as cenas e os momentos da série, mas também adiciona profundidade e emoção à experiência do espectador. Em resumo, a primeira temporada de One Piece na Netflix é uma jornada épica que faz jus ao material original em muitos aspectos. A série consegue equilibrar a ação, a comédia, o drama e a excentricidade que tornam One Piece tão amado pelos fãs. Com um elenco talentoso, direção habilidosa e efeitos visuais impressionantes, esta adaptação live-action é um presente para os fãs e uma porta de entrada para aqueles que ainda não tiveram a oportunidade de explorar esse mundo vasto e fascinante. Embora algumas escolhas de adaptação possam gerar debates, o resultado final é, sem dúvida, uma experiência que vale a pena tanto para os amantes do chapéu de palha quanto para novos espectadores.",0.7096,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-08,"Staring the same emotions in me as the anime & manga The One Piece live-action adaptation comes remarkably close to perfection in my eyes, with just one minor caveat. The inclusion of a plotline from the later stages of One Piece felt slightly premature. Nevertheless, the series excels in most other aspects. The casting choices have been spot on, capturing the essence of the characters. While there were occasional moments when the Straw Hat crew's authenticity wavered, they quickly rebounded. Only a few instances for each character felt a tad forced, but they were fleeting. One Piece live-action successfully reignited the same emotions within me that the anime and manga have over the years. I sincerely hope it continues to thrive, and I eagerly anticipate what lies ahead in this captivating adaptation. ^_^",0.9406,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Didn't go over the top to make it a naturalistic take on a anime and the CGI wasn't overdone, yet definitely was unafraid to ask the viewers to accept many fictional naunces that Anime and manga do.

2023-09-07,"A Promising Start: One Piece Live-Action Series Delights with Arlong Park Arc When I first heard that ""One Piece"" was getting a live-action adaptation, my expectations were tempered with caution. Adapting such a beloved and expansive manga and anime series is no small feat, and many fans, myself included, were worried about how it would translate to the small screen. However, after watching the first season, which covers the Arlong Park arc, I'm thrilled to say that the ""One Piece"" live-action series has far surpassed my initial expectations. One of the most impressive aspects of this adaptation is the dedication to faithfully recreating Oda's world. The sets, costumes, and visual effects transport viewers to the familiar and fantastic world of the Grand Line. The bustling streets of Cocoyasi Village, the imposing Arlong Park itself, and the eerie depths of the ocean are brought to life with incredible attention to detail. The creators have succeeded in capturing the essence of Oda's imaginative world. One of my biggest concerns was how the characters would be portrayed. The cast of ""One Piece"" is iconic, and fans have strong attachments to these characters. However, the cast of the live-action series delivers solid performances that capture the essence of their respective roles. The actor portraying Monkey D. Luffy embodies the character's boundless energy and determination, making it easy to root for him. Similarly, the supporting cast, including Nami, Zoro, and Usopp, bring their characters to life with authenticity and charisma. The chemistry between the Straw Hat Pirates is a standout feature of the series. Their interactions feel genuine, and you can sense the camaraderie that makes this crew so endearing. The relationships between characters are explored in depth, adding depth to the story and providing a satisfying emotional resonance. While the live-action adaptation covers only the Arlong Park arc, it manages to capture the heart of ""One Piece."" The storytelling is faithful to the source material, with a well-paced narrative that allows for character development and world-building. The adaptation doesn't rush through the events, giving viewers a chance to fully immerse themselves in the story and the challenges the Straw Hat Pirates face. The action sequences, while not as grand in scale as some of the later arcs in the manga and anime, are still thrilling and well-executed. The battles at Arlong Park are intense and showcase the physicality and abilities of the characters. The special effects and stunts add to the excitement, and it's clear that the production team invested considerable effort into making these scenes visually engaging. In conclusion, the ""One Piece"" live-action series, covering the Arlong Park arc, has pleasantly surprised me and left me eagerly awaiting more. It successfully captures the essence of the beloved source material, with strong performances, faithful storytelling, and impressive world-building. While it only scratches the surface of the ""One Piece"" saga, it's a promising start that bodes well for the future of the series. If you're a fan of ""One Piece,"" this adaptation is a must-watch, and I can't wait to see where it sails next.",0.9982,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-07,"I grew up with One Piece, and I have followed the story since 2009. Besides this, I am educated in filmmaking and storytelling, I have written my own book of the fiction genre and it was heavily influenced by One Piece. I consider One Piece a masterpiece, especially, of worldbuilding that might be an exclusive benefit of a long-running show where the author has enough time to flesh out characters and pre-planned storylines to put readers or viewers into awe. In this sense, nothing comes close to One Piece and it has its own unique vibe even among Shonen manga series like Naruto, Bleach, or Dragon Ball. I followed many other live-action anime adaptations and I always thought it was just impossible to translate them, but I also understood that there was not enough care put into these shows, the best example of this is Death Note which was truly awful, there were made changes that didn't make any sense, it was dry and missed many important things that made this show so popular and amazing, it was outright dumb. There were many changes in One Piece Live Action as well, but these changes were justified, and were smart to condense around 60 episodes of anime into 8 live-action episodes. The cast was just perfect, the music was really good and overall acting was really good, even secondary characters. But, the most important thing why I am rating this show so highly is that it was funny, emotional, wholesome, and everything that the original story always delivers, the show perfectly translated that vibe of One Piece that we all love so much and I can't wait for the second season.",0.9954,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-07,"Seeing how oh so many other anime adaptations have turned out in the past, I was very worried about this one. But for once, fans were not let down. The live adaptation captures the core essence and feel of the show so well that all the things that work in the anime but should look cartoonish in real life soon feel just natural. Sure, a lot of the source material had to be trimmed and reworked, but there was not one choice that I felt was flat-out bad. I still prefer the original, but I would recommend this show to both long-time-fans and newcomers without any hesitation. And because I think nobody has said it yet: Craig Fairbrass playing Zeff is one of the best performances on camera I've ever seen in any show or movie. Fairbrass genuinly made this former pirate captain turned full-time-chef with the two foot long braided mustache who owns a fish-shaped restaurant/ship on the open ocean seem like he could absolutely be a real-life person. Absolutely stunning.",0.9795,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-07,"It was actually a really good adaptation, although I wished Luffy still fought Don Krieg, and it kinda bummed me off he ended up just like that.It's one of my favorite fights in the East Blue saga along with Luffy vs Arlong. Also felt the syrup village arc was stretched a little too long, and if they're able to put 8 episodes up to the Arlong Park Arc, I'm pretty sure they could've put 10 episodes instead to squeeze in the fights between Luffy vs Don Krieg, Sanji vs Gin. Overall pretty could show, and I enjoyed the cast. The world building is really great too. It has some original content not from the anime or manga, which makes og fans have a great new experience.",0.9744,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Not necessarily a 1-on-1 adaptation but definitely carries the same spirit. Great casting and acting, neat writing, well-paced plot. A lot of people is hesitant to jump in to the One Piece world due to the extensive source material (over 1100 manga chapters) or they simply couldn't care less with watching anime, so I really appreciate that we can have another gateway for people to get to experience One Piece through this live action.

2023-09-07,"This is truly a near-perfect adaptation. Except for some changes made in the Syrup Village arc, which has some pacing and quality issues, this adaptation of the One Piece manga bests even the anime in how it tells the East Blue Saga. From writing to set design, each frame is pouring with love for the source material. The cast ARE the straw hat pirates, each member is so perfectly cast, written, and portrayed. The world feels so vast and lived in, that the show sweeps you away into an exciting and eccentric place filled with weird hair, weird characters, and weird locations. The action and set pieces here are exhilarating. Roll on season 2! I hope this cast and this team are able to complete each saga in live-action to be enjoyed for years and years to come.

Penso que era necessário mais atenção em detalhes do desenvolvimento dos membros do bando, mais entendo que é difícil com poucos episódios.

When those scenes being reimagined the nostalgia hit me. The memories of my childhood watching this show made me feel warm with joy. I know I sound like a fanboy and maybe a bit biased but it doesn't matter even if you know about One Piece anime or not.

I hope that this type of comedy+action+teary+touching+full-of-surprise storytelling can be maintained until they found the One Piece, unlike the anime series that has been ridiculously lost its originality...Mr Oda changed/interfered it too much I guess.

2023-09-06,"As a person who's been reading/watching One Piece for 18 years, I have to say that they did the source material justice! Even with some shaky visuals and basically speedrunning the story to fit it in 8 episodes, the live adaptation manages to capture the most important thing of what makes the original source material so great: The fun, sometimes goofy, sometimes heartbreaking spirit of One Piece. This is a template of how adaptations should be made and I really hope they keep in up and improve on future seasons.",0.9694,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-06,"For a first-season-anime-live-action-show this ABSOLUTELY blew my socks off. From insanely good casting and acting, to incredible sets and costuming, this is a show that, if it continues, will be the standard for any live-action adaptations to come. Fantastic, funny, and full of deep moments of friendship. Oda's original source material isn't disrespected but expanded in this exciting adventure.",0.9362,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-06,"Is it the best anime adaption? Probably. Is it good? That's a different story. Sometimes, the blend of practical effects, fun CGI, wacky presentation, and over-the-top storytelling makes it a delight to watch. Sometimes, the costuming, the bizarre dutch angles and weird framing, and the absolute cartoonish interpretations of the ""anime aesthetic"" makes it look like you're watching a Youtube fanfilm But at the end of the day, this is fine. It does everything it sets out to do, and doesn't screw up. If you have low expectations for anime adaptions into cinema, then hey, this isn't an embarrassment. It's awkward, and strange, and difficult to recommend. But for people looking for exactly this, it's going to scratch all the itches.",0.8054,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

While I don't necessarily agree with everything they did, I believe the cast is wonderfully and truly brought life to 'One Piece'.

2023-09-06,"What makes this show good: the cast is perfect, a nice mix of genres including action, drama, some humor, and a decent plot What makes this show bad: the cliché anime moment at the end of episode 7 when Luffy yells ""Of course I will!"" into the sky",0.807,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-06,"Netflix's One Piece live-action TV series is a faithful adaptation of the beloved manga and anime series. The cast is excellent, with Inaki Godoy giving a charming and energetic performance as Luffy, and Mackenyu bringing a lot of swagger to the role of Zoro. The production values are also top-notch, with the special effects used to bring Luffy's Devil Fruit powers to life being particularly impressive. The series follows the early adventures of Luffy and his crew as they set out on a journey to find the One Piece, the legendary treasure that will make them the Pirate King. The first eight episodes cover the East Blue Saga, which introduces the Straw Hat Pirates and some of their most iconic enemies, including Buggy the Clown and Arlong. The series does a good job of capturing the spirit of the original material, while also making some changes that make it more accessible to a live-action audience. For example, the series has a more linear narrative than the manga or anime, and it condenses some of the storylines. However, these changes are mostly minor, and they don't detract from the overall experience. Overall, Netflix's One Piece live-action TV series is a faithful and entertaining adaptation of the beloved manga and anime series. It's a must-watch for fans of the original, and it's also a great introduction to the world of One Piece for newcomers. Here are some specific things that I liked about the series: The casting was excellent. Inaki Godoy was a perfect fit for the role of Luffy, and he brought a lot of energy and charisma to the character. Mackenyu was also great as Zoro, and he had a lot of fun with the role. The rest of the cast was also good, and they all did a great job of bringing their characters to life. The production values were top-notch. The special effects used to bring Luffy's Devil Fruit powers to life were particularly impressive. The sets and costumes were also well-made, and they helped to create a realistic and immersive world. The series was faithful to the original material. The writers did a good job of adapting the manga and anime into a live-action format. They made some changes, but they were mostly minor, and they didn't detract from the overall experience. The series was entertaining. It was a fun and exciting adventure story that kept me engaged from beginning to end. I laughed, I cried, and I cheered for the Straw Hat Pirates. If you're a fan of One Piece, then you'll definitely want to check out the live-action TV series. It's a faithful and entertaining adaptation that will make you feel like you're part of the Straw Hat Pirates' journey. And if you're not a fan of One Piece, then this is a great opportunity to check out the series and see why it's so popular.",0.9985,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Please keep up the good work and keep the original story unchanged and you cannot miss!!! Good job actors and production team!!!,0.9612,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-06,"It is not a one for one telling of the anime adaptation but it looks to be following it as closely as possible. The casting is very good and the actors do personify the anime characters very well, most notably is Luffy, the actor really plays his carefree and happy go lucky character very well. Zoro is done almost perfect and the look of the actor is what one would imagine the character would look like if brought to life. Usop's actor does not fit the anime character's look as well but his acting more than makes up for it. Ultimately the casting is near spot on. The special effects are somewhat cartoonish but it fits the environment very well, which of course has cartoonish elements blended into it. All in all I feel the live action adaptation of One Piece is worth the watch and hopefully keeps gaining momentum so that it can be a long running series like its anime parent.",0.995,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

The story is great, some of them has changed follow the current era but still respect to the origin. Every episode I watched remain remain me to the anime.

2023-09-06,"Came into this with scepticism as I do follow the manga and I feared of its failure. My main criteria for success was if the adaptation kept the spirit and intent of each character from the manga/anime. With great surprise, they've kept the spirits of all of the characters for both the major and minor characters. As a bonus, the script wasn't corny and the plot was pretty good. The only fault in this adaptation is that it was too compressed. There were moments in the manga that helped provide more emotional context to the daunting situations that the characters were in which was left out. Overall, it's surprisingly good.",0.945,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

The world and lore they set up is intriguing, but more importantly, the characters are all focused and relatable. Everyone is very well-characterized, especially Nami and Zoro, and have clear arcs to complete as the story continues to progress. Couple that with great action and a few genuine emotional moments, and this becomes the best live action anime ever made. Almost good enough to make me pick up the original show.",0.9886,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-06,"As a fan of the One Piece Anime, I was cautiously optimistic while also having my expectations on the floor. Well the One Piece Live-Action adaptation is great. It keeps the spirit of the show while not being a carbon copy of the anime. The moments of cringe from directly copying an animated character as a real person, are non-existent. The major players from the first 4 arcs all included, but the plot is altered to tie chracters together and progress the story cohesively more like an orginal TV show. All the moments you hope to get, are included and the emtionaly weight of certain moments translate beautifully. Highly reccommend this show.",0.9769,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

I gave this a hard pass when it popped up on Netflops but after catching some reviews I decided to give it a whirl. And I'm sure glad I did. The main character has a brilliant endearing quality about him, kudos to the actor who plays him! The ""supporting"" cast each have their qualities and niches but don't step on each other toes. I'm 3 episodes in an so far there's been zero Hollywood preaching/Messaging (so sad this has to be a major plus these days!). The Clown Pirate (sorry forgot names already) was really good and the actor playing him was really enjoying chewing the scenery. So far it's been great to watch and loose yourself in. Set pieces are well done, world building was done pretty well and overall top quality. Enough to make me into an Anime convert? Probably not but I shall continue to enjoy this. Hopefully it'll be a while before some Hollywood idiot ruins this but for now it's certainly worth a watch.",0.995,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Mantiveram a essência mesmo tendo modificado o roteiro e funcionou muito bem neste formato. Pretendo ver ao menos mais 3 vezes. Os atores foram maravilhosos em seus papéis. Inaki mandou bem demais como nossa tão amado Luffy, Jacob parece ter nascido para interpretar Usopp, Emily foi uma Nami sensacional, Mackenyu nem parecia estar interpretando de tão natural que seu Zoro pareceu e o Taz eu acho que nem preciso comentar, simplesmente o melhor Sanji possível! Eu simplesmente amei cada cena de interação, cada cena de ação e como nossos queridos Chapéus de Palha ganharam vida. Super recomendo. A série não é perfeita, mas sendo sincero não imagino como poderiam fazer melhor do que foi feito. Simplesmente One Piece.",0.8908,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-05,"Overall it was a great start for a first season of a new show. It's extremely difficult to make a live action from an anime due to the pacing, special effects and world building. I think they did a very good job in season 1 and I cannot wait for season 2. I do believe this is a show for the fans of one piece instead of a show anyone can watch. Some of the stuff is a bit cheesey but so is one piece in general. Overall I think ODA did an amazing job and I hope they will continue it",0.928,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Sure there were moments that I wish could have been included but I think the overall story comes through pretty cleanly. As someone currently watching the anime and trying to get my hands on the manga, there was only one singular spoiler of something that I've been told is revealed somewhere around the 300th episode, while I'm currently on 148, but I don't think it's too big a deal. There are definitely some Easter eggs that went over my head that I look forward to spotting on a rewatch when I'm further along in the anime.

It looks great and somehow captures the silly hijinks and dramatic character development of the source material balancing both in a shorter run time. One niggle would be the fight choreography could be a little more polished but it flows well and is exciting. Showcasing each character and elevating none above the rest. It uses each set creatively. Set creation, costume and CG departments obviously worked really hard and it shows because it looks fantastic and is exactly how I would imagine a top quality live action One Piece would look.",0.9683,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

A série tem uma leve barriga no arco do Usopp, e o flashback muito rápido, o tornando o pior da série, sem impacto nenhum, mas o personagem Usopp é divertido!! Depois do episódio 4 adiante, a série emerge em boas tomadas, com boas mensagens, como os homens peixes, tendo uma clara referência ao povo negro. A série possuí vilões diversos, e cada um bem peculiar, o Luffy é muito bem em sua evolução como capitão! Juntos de outros integrantes tendo sua evolução diante dos episódios.

2023-09-05,"Epic as a fan of OP, It's by far the most amazing anime of this time, and it has so much more to go hats off to Netflix for this epic first season.",0.7501,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-05,"Attempting to summarize 100 chapters, which is 6 entire arcs of the Manga in just 8 episodes is truly a miracle. When you think about the narrative choices around this Season 1, it was clear that Oda and the team decided to focus on providing as much backstory and character development as possible for Luffy and his initial team of 5 before they set off to the Grand Line. Furthermore, they double-downed on wanting to make sure it was crystal clear what core events/scenarios led them to join Luffy on his adventure. With those 2 key objectives in mind, they cut, trimmed, and adjusted the story to allow for the 2 core story elements to shine while everything around it was a mechanism to tell this tale. Of course, this led to a lot of side characters being completely omitted, introducing key characters earlier, drastically slimming down the number of battle scenes, and changing some aspects of the entire storyline while retaining the core essence of each individual's most pivotal plot point. Now it is easy to point out the flaws, the cringe, the awkwardness, the meh of the Live Action Adaptation but this was an amazing first go at One Piece and I truly hope they continue this Live Action Series because it felt like they had figured out the wrinkles in the story pacing by episode 7/8 and I'm sure Season 2 will surpass Season 1.",0.9829,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-05,"I have been a loyal fan of One Piece manga for more than 20 years. At first, I thought season 1 could not describe the characters' personalities well because you must follow them for a certain period to get to know them. But I was wrong, the live-action version really did a perfect job, even if it was limited in a short timeframe. It is the most-watched movie of the year 2023",0.5783,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-05,Fiquei extremamente surpreso.... uma série que conseguiu manter a qualidade da obra original com uma adaptação maravilhosa de roteiro e com uma caracterização fantástica.... único ponto fraco é os efeitos especiais em alguns momentos e uma ou outra cena que não ficou legal mas muito pontual. Outro ponto a melhorar é a cor dos cabelos que ficou muito artificial tentando se aproximar do anime. De qualquer forma achei fantástico os atores e a forma que foi apresentado. Série nota 10... nem parece da Netflix hehe,0.4215,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-05,"Netflix finally did it. A live action that is not only not cringe, but actually very good. Though not a beat per beat recreation of the anime, which in this case is a good call, I as a fan of the manga and the anime really felt that One Piece DNA. This is proof that as long as the creators respect the source material, they can create a very good series. Bravo Netflix! I can't wait for season 2!",0.9743,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-05,"I didn't watch the anime but this turned out to be fantastic. They had great actors, fantastic visuals, and it was a overall pretty good story.

Buenas actuaciones, buenos escenarios (también cgi), y casi fiel a la historia original.",0.3182,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-05,"Considerando o extremo desafio de adaptar uma obra grandiosa e fantasiosa como One Piece, é seguro dizer que a Netflix conseguiu, ela trouxe ao público uma boa adaptação de anime, uma boa adaptação da obra original. Levando em consideração que se trata de uma série, a avaliação costuma ser bem diferente, e digo isso por conta de sua produção e direção de arte que estão muito boas para um seriado. Os figurinos estão belíssimos e cheios de originalidade, os cenários são bem aproveitados e os efeitos especiais tem seu valor, tudo está muito bom tecnicamente falando, infelizmente não posso dizer o mesmo da direção e de algumas atuações. Na maioria dos episódios a direção é bem mediana, sempre escolhendo planos ruins e conduzindo as cenas de maneira confusa nos momentos de ação, vale lembrar que uma série com planos sequência precisa de um controle a mais na direção para fazer sentido dentro da narrativa, não basta apenas copiar as cenas do original, é necessário melhorar. As atuações infelizmente estão ruins, beirando o vergonhoso, sempre muito caricato e exagerado, porém, tem espaço para melhorar futuramente. O saldo final é positivo!",-0.3595,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-05,"As a fan of the animé, I can say this is definitely a decent attempt at a live action series, and probably the best adaptation so far. What makes it work for me most, is the casting, specially the lead; and the music, both are superb in my opinion.",0.9231,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-05,"The show passed my expectations. It is a very fun watch. Now it isn't perfect by any means but I believe most things I did not like could be improved in season 2. 1) Please have more cinematic shots instead of stylized zoom-ins. 2) CGI felt the worst in cases which should be the easiest to get right (explosions, swords shattering, ship breaking in two). Luffy deflecting the cannonball and it exploding felt like a copy-paste of a 14 y/o's After-Effect tutorial. 3) Sets looked great BUT they oftentimes felt empty. I know they are true to manga but in live-action emptyness feels fake. For example, when Blackbeard meets Straw Hats in the future it would look extremely weird if the whole background is made white. Some things work in manga, some things work in real life. Work with the medium. As a HUGE fan of the original I wouldn't mind it getting even more off the original in terms of design and directing.",0.9676,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-05,"Season One: I can honestly say that I'm pretty satisfied with the results. I was a little concerned when I learned that my all time favorite anime was going to get a live action series - even after I learned that Eiichiro Oda was working with the people working on this project, I was still skeptical. But after watching it, I can definitely see the faithfulness to Oda's source materiel while also being a bit more ground; and trying out something a little different. I was pretty happy with the casting choice, as most of the actors did a fantastic job at portraying their respected characters - my favorite being the portrayal of Dracule Mihawk; despite his limited appearances in the anime and manga, he has always been one of my favorite characters (and I was more than happy to see him getting more screen time on this series). And while I did like Mackenyu as Roronoa Zoro, his portrayal at times came off as weak - I get that he was trying to capture the stern and seriousness of Zoro, but he doesn't really have the voice for it just yet, which is why I think he could have used just a bit more energy. And while Iñaki Godoy's acting also came off as weak at times, his personality usually made up for it. I get that there is only so much you can do with real people, and you have so much more room with animation, which is why plenty of stuff was cut out in the first season. But I really wish it had at least ten episodes, if it would have helped for us to see more of the characters we enjoyed and it could have helped build up more of the story - such as Don Krieg, Pearl, Genzo, Nojiko, Cabaji, Merry, Gin, Patty, Mohji, Mayor Boodle, Kuroobi, Choo, and even Arlong's sawblade, or a bit more on the relationships between the crew and their past; as well as the people in their lives. And while there were times when the choreography was obvious, most of the times it was done very well. And I don't object for diversity, just as long as it makes sense. I really do hope that Netflix keeps these people on their payroll, so they can continue bringing this amazing world to life.",0.9973,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-05,"the adaptation does not really meet the expectations of a true one piece fan who has accompanied the mugiwara for more than 10 years, part of the charm of this anime is the humor that we do not see in live action. I don't entirely believe that Eiichiro Oda approved the adaptation 100%, I think its success was more due to the hype on social networks sponsored by Netflix",0.9371,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-05,"As someone who's watched the entire anime to date, the show did a great job adapting the anime for the live-action and cast the characters very well.

I didn't really follow the trailers, but I'm grateful that I decided to check it out, because honestly, you can see the love and care for Eiichiro Oda‘s masterpiece known to thousands! I'm super grateful that the actors and directors brought this Manga/ Anime to life even if it's not a 1:1 depiction; the stories of each character are told beautifully. I think it's crucial to have the creators of any manga, anime, or video games actively present and guiding the process through. Similar to the ""Last of Us,"" who actively had creators involved it allows the creator and directors to have creative freedom and provide a different take of their original story. Overall, this was a beautiful take to the Manga/Anime. Great job and I'm excited for Season Two!",0.9976,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

A caracterização,a ambientação,a história,tudo bem elaborado e impecável!! E o que falar da atuação, simplesmente incrível,todos estão de parabéns,mas o que Inaki Godoy fez,foi nível Yonkou,vi nele o Luffy que tanto me divertiu e ainda diverte no anime e mangá,com o jeito tapado e engraçado,e a genialidade em batalha. A história realmente é bem fechadinha e dinâmica,o que melhorou em comparação com o anime/mangá,nessa primeira parte. Claro tratar de uma adaptação,mas senti que faltou um pouco de ""sangue"" nas batalhas, principalmente contra Arlong,onde Luffy mostra estar disposto a derramar o próprio sangue pra salvar seus companheiros,o que mostrava o perigo real de cada batalha e faz nós fãs adoramos o Capitão Dos Chapéus de Palha,mas de forma geral,uma nota 9.9 é o ideal.",0.4184,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-04,"Everybody involved in this made an *excellent* job and created an adaptation that's vibrant, hilarious, exciting, and that brought back full force all the feelings from reading those first volumes of the manga for the first time more than twenty years ago. The cast is absolutely perfect and gives such an earnest interpretation, from the Straw Hat Crew to all the villains (a special shout out to Buggy, his mix of creepy and silly was spot on) to even the smaller side character. I thought the secondary storyline about Garp, Koby, and Helmeppo was a good addiction and created balance. But it's the building relationship between the Straw Hats that's really the shining light in this adaptation, as it should be! Almost all the changes in the plot made sense with the time constraint, really my only complaint is this could have easily had at least one episode more. The set and costumes are another highlight, I loved how nobody was afrid to embrace the over the top, occasionally absurd aesthetic that makes One Piece so unique and impactful. It was great! And I also appreciated how they worked very hard not to have a rushed ending, but instead took their time with an epilogue that was emotional and just pumped up the excitement for the season 2 i so very hope we get up through the roof!

You can just tell how much attention to detail and originality the creators behind Oda have put into it. I look forward to season 2 and the further hunt for the One Piece. Good job Netflix!",0.9303,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-04,"Portugues-Br= Série maravilhosa, que obra bem feita e detalhada, chamaria quase de um spin-off da série original que mantém a qualidade, têm diferenças do anime mas sinto que as diferenças acentuam a obra como algo especial ao invés de retirar do original, que bom que o autor participou das produções, da pra ver que isso fez a diferença em escolha de atores e tomada de decisões.

I loved watching it.",0.9008,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-04,"Lots of problems. Needless story changes from anime. All of the characters are not fantastical enough (everyone should be more extreme; overly buff men, enormously well endowed curvaceous women, over the top personalities, etc) and probably worst of all Luffy isn't funny/goofy ( rubber brained). This is exacerbated by the actor's default smile having a downward cast making him more dark than happy/friendly. Nice try but tragically flawed. Not going to convert any non anime viewers into fans. Just watch the anime",-0.8908,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-04,"Been a fan of One Piece for quite a long time, and I need to say this Live Action was an absolute delight to watch. It remains faithful to the escence of the series and it's characters while bringing a new perspective into it's world by taking risks we didn't aboard on the original source such as the permanent death of a character or, taking the anime into account, sticking to it's original source (Sanji's past). As for the missing half star, that's due to one change that I didn't really deemed necessary (spoiler (a small change in Nami's past, while it doesn't affect the overall story nor betrays the character escence, can't deny it would have been lovely they gave young Nojiko a bit more of focus by sticking up to the origin of her tattooes, therefore, not changing the nature of their relationship). Asides from that, it's an amazing live action, hope there's a 2 season.",0.9629,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-04,"I was surprised at how simply FUN the show turned out. There are many flaws with the show's production but generally, it's FUN. I am a fan of the Anime and Manga so I have bias. But my bias made me more critical of the show rather than being appreciative. A lot of scenes where cringy in live action. After rewatching it with my whole family I came to see it with their eyes and found myself being charmed by the awesome ride that is being a Straw Hat. I recommend enjoying the show with the whole family. It is violent for viewers under thirteen but if you have a Netflix subscription I bet my Tesla Shares that your kid has watched Bigmouth.

It won me over immediately, the first episode was amazing. Watched the show within a couple of days and loved it. The cast really works, the costumes are very true to the show, and the action/stunts are really cool. I didn't think they could make such a weird show work in Live action, but they really pulled it off. There are minor details that are different, and it just doesn't matter.

That all said, this is such a crazy, over the top, imaginative show, it is hard not to like it. There is a lot of energy, the actors did a decent job in a Harry Potter sort of way. The diversity casting, unlike so many other horrible shows, actually strengthens this manga craziness, as each character is more wildly differentiated (you can only do so much with hair dye). To top it off, as a geography major, I can appreciate that one of the heros is a cartographer.",0.7261,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-04,"As a fan of the source material for over a decade, I believe this live action adaptation faithfully translated the best parts of the series into a new medium. It was not a complete copy and paste of the original, the elements that make One Piece unique and so beloved by fans around the world stayed and were treated with so much love and respect. There were very small thing that I didn't fully enjoy, like a couple of CGI scenes here and there, some of the character arcs that I wished were more like the source material. But in the end, these feel more like nitpicks and they don't really affect my score overall. I accept the ONE PIECE live action as its own thing, and I absolutely love how they kept the heart and soul of the series.

2023-09-04,"The series is watchable. It's not terrible, but it's also not the best adaptation ever made. I have to give credit for being the best live-action adaptation of an anime when compared to what has been done before in this genre. However, compared to the original work, it falls short. This review contains spoilers. I've been following One Piece since I was 14, and since then, I've experienced a lot of emotions in front of my computer screen as I followed this crew and their dynamics through various adventures. I had high hopes for this live-action adaptation based on the interviews, the way the actors interacted, and even the trailer. However, my three stars are only for the first episode and the Arlong saga because the rest is just a downhill slide of frustration. There were some changes I found interesting, like altering the timeline of certain events or introducing characters earlier. However, the series greatly falls short in character development, lacks emotional impact in scenes that should be moving, and consequently, has a shallow plot. There's no time to feel the weight of the scenes and the bonds because the script rushes to deliver as much information as possible, with numerous battle scenes that weren't necessary. Crucial details for creating emotion and defining characters' motivations were simply omitted. For example, in the first episode, before leaving the Conch Town, Luffy picks a fight with Koby precisely so that Koby wouldn't be associated with him because Koby wanted to become a marine (a scene completely removed). Another scene is Sanji's departure from the Baratie: when Sanji leaves, all the chefs are outside to bid farewell, praising his talent, and Sanji kneels and tearfully thanks everyone at Baratie and Chef Zeff, showing how humble Sanji is and how important the Baratie is to his character (another scene poorly adapted). What I mean by bringing up these examples is that they removed what they should have focused on and tried to create punchlines with other scenes that weren't the focus. I think the characters who suffered the most were Zoro and Garp. Two incredible characters who were simply trivialized in the series. Zoro has the charisma of a door in the series, and his motivations have become so selfish that his lines about being part of the crew are empty and make no sense. Seriously, I think the actor only knows how to act like a badass, and it's annoying. Zoro doesn't act like a badass; his actions end up giving that impression, but he's not like that at his core. And the actor is Japanese, grew up with One Piece, and couldn't capture the essence of the character. Garp seems more like a villain, even though his character is the most parental figure in the world of One Piece. It's sad to see how his relationship with Koby developed in the series, especially when in the manga, we had the climax of their relationship, and what Garp meant to Koby and what Koby meant to Garp is completely different. The way the series portrayed his efforts to capture Luffy, when Garp always made sure to leave Luffy alone and never interfere, is painful to watch. In the original work, Garp never supported Luffy, and he was strict, but he would never prevent Luffy's dream like the series depicts. He would never do that! Also, it seems like Garp is emotionally dead in the series, very different from his original personality, which is lively, considering he's the damn hero of the navy. If they had to make someone chase after Luffy in the series, they should have included Smoker because it would have allowed them to skip Loguetown or pass through it more quickly (since the series takes this tone). Above all, One Piece is a political story, built on the relationships within the crew and on each island they visit, as they come into contact with the cruel reality of that world while bringing liberation from suffering because Luffy is a metaphor for freedom. I think what came closest, and I'm being generous, to this was the episode where Usopp joins the crew, and finally the part with Nami. In the Arlong Park arc, we had what would truly be One Piece: they arrive on the island, see the cruelty the people are subjected to, and the crew forms bonds with the people and the town. In summary, I'll continue to watch because it's my favorite show, but it's not all that great. It's just another addition for those who already follow it, and for someone who has never followed or doesn't know anything about One Piece, starting with the series is definitely not recommended.",0.9865,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

But here's where the plot thickens. Come mid-season, it's as if someone flipped a switch. Suddenly, dialogues weren't just idle banter; they had substance. Those characters I'd written off?

Great casting: the cast give heartfelt and sincere performances Brill production: you can see that Netflix and the crew wanted to honour Oda/One Piece well through set design and amazing set pieces Good balance of tone: One Piece in itself blends in a variety of tones, from comedy, humour, to hearty adventure, to serious and dramatic -- this adaptation most certainly strikes the balance well in this too Made with passion, care, and love: Above points tie in with this, but if you know the source material (i.e. anime, manga) - then you can see the little Easter eggs and references sprinkled in the mix; the combination of all of this just shows the attention-to-detail the crew and cast had; and the spirit to do themselves, Oda, and the community proud.

2023-09-03,"A totally different series from those fantasy ones. This series is about High school Gangsters and how a person with timing travelling power trying to change their life. The plot is really interesting, high schoolers turned into gangsters, their fight, action, friendship, love, betrayal. It has everything along with time travelling science fiction. I loved the characterisation of Mikey, the way his character designed is awesome. A Gang leader doesn't necessarily need to tall, bulk muscle guy. Mikey is short, petite yet the strongest person in the entire series. A great leader who can just bring his gang together with his speech and action. And this guy is full of style, long hair, flying his jacket on shoulder, fighting with his flipflops, roaming around in PJs. He has his childish side where he call his fellow mates with nick names, teasing them and he also has his devil side where he is ready to kill them without mercy. I would say he is one of the best designed anime character.",0.8802,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

I'm new to One Piece, I always wanted to know about it, but adulthood and 1000+ of anime episodes discouraged me to keep watching. So this is a perfect and condensed way to fall in love with this universe. Also I think Iñaki Godoy is one of those rare cases of casting done right!

2023-09-03,"Great take on One Piece, given only 8 episodes I do feel perhaps with 10 they would have been able to do better as some aspects feel rushed and not building enough for the critical scenes to have as much of an emotional impact as the anime. However, it changes things in a refreshing way and is truly a success in translating to live action what initially seemed impossible. I hope for season 2 and more episodes per season. 8.5/10 for me.",0.9413,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

It's kinda easy to watch and the story goes so quickly so it doesn't make me feel tired to watch it. Also the voice actors are from the original anime so it also made me crazy. Thank for the Netflix and O'Day Eiichiro.,0.797,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

While there are still some flaws and minor problems like the lack of buildup and things that are cut out or missed because of time, i don't blame the staff for that, while it is annoying that things like usopp getting relentlessly beat up to protect other people is gone, i hope they make it up by showing moments like that next season...!",0.8991,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-03,"Netflix One Piece is a faithful adaptation of the manga bearing the same name. Iñaki Godoy is fitting actor for the lead role. He captures Monkey D Luffy's character effortlessly. This production's interpretation of the manga's visual design from set pieces to costumes to practical prosthetics and make-up are so obviously inspired from the anime. Even the CGI effects, color grading are spot-on to the source material. Although condensed into 8 episodes, each episode tries to encorporate crucial story bits from 66 episodes of the anime into a cohesively interconnected tapestry. So far, Netflix bat this out of the park. You do not want to miss this especially if you're an anime fan. Cheers.",0.9001,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Zoro in particular was portrayed impeccably. There will be moments were the story moves past some iconic original moments, however the over arcing concepts are not lost in translation. The ""sense' of the one piece world has been capture in an impressive way visually as well as through character representation.

2023-09-03,"The live action adaptation of this anime series strikes a delicate balance between fidelity and innovation. It honors the original source material without being slavish to it, and adds some fresh elements without being arrogant or disrespectful. The challenge, however, is to make the quirky dialogues sound natural and convincing in a live action format, which sometimes results in cheesy or awkward moments. Moreover, some of the dramatic payoffs are undermined by the lack of proper exposition or the uneven performance of the actors. Despite these flaws, the series is a commendable effort that deserves praise and recognition.",0.9264,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-03,"As a long time fan of the manga and anime (over half my life), this was really embarrassing. Everyone saying ""it's great for a live action of an anime"" is really forgetting that if they're all bad, then the greatest of them is still probably pretty bad. At times, it reminded me of the stage plays they had at Tokyo Tower or at Universal Theme Park in Japan (as I've seen on YouTube), but they at least had the cultural and language nuances to sustain the best and must important aspects of the source material (which, btw, is based on Journey to the West). That and it's really unacceptable to ask an audience to look at White ppl and accept that they have Japanese names like Sanji and Nami, esp post-Scar Jo Ghost in the Shell-gate. Too much of what makes One Piece so great (writing, chemistry, comedy, joyfulness, creativity, etc) is lost in this painfully obvious cash grab from a flailing Netflix desperate to find the financial successor of Stranger Things/Wednesday. Though it's similar at face-value, OP has way more important things to say than just ""a bunch of kids with weird powers go on adventures against mysterious and powerful institutions only to find their strongest power is friendship."" Overall: campy in an unfun way, almost aggressively cheap-looking, depressingly lacking comedically, and unapologetically racist. Watch the anime instead. Or paint dry honestly.",0.9858,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-03,"Is great to see a show that respect the esence of a global love story and dont try to make it in something else. A main character in anime is different that a main character in a superhero movie, and Hollywood finally notice.",0.9081,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-03,"This show has finally broken Netflix's Anime-Live Action Adaptation curse. I'm a One Piece fan, and for live action adaptations, ratings of OG fans is the most vital, coz' if we love it, it means that they didn't mess up stuff. Coming to the rating: I gave 4🌟 for its ✓amazing OSTs - literally every BGM is extraordinary imo ✓lovely cast - most of us already love them ☺️ ✓Exciting Screenplay - for an Adventure genre plot, I love the screenplay so much ✓Beautiful production sets. ❤️🔥 So much love to the sets. I'm very glad that didn't go with CGI where they could've gone, but gave us beutiful sets. Reason for the deduction of 1🌟 is: (I reduced .5 for both, coz' they're personal opinions) × .5⭐ : I liked the anime version of Zeff's leg loosing plot and Bellemere-san's death plot, more than the live action's. I don't see any problem keeping the former, coz' they're so good imo. × .5⭐ : Issues with pacing. I felt a drag in the Syrup village battle scenes, just like I did with Anime as well. I wish they could've fixed it. And I felt a rush with Nami's backstory. But, still... I'd definitely recommend people NOT TO MISS THIS ELEMENT OF MAGIC ✨",0.9868,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

It's something new for me and had so many doubts for it since I was never a fan of the One Piece animated series and movies. Never read the manga never liked it I'm being honest. Though after watching this show I put full attention towards it, I would be ready on the fights, seeing a lot of familiar things after seeing the first episode of the animated series man I snapped so much. This film deserves a lot of attention especially to people who don't like One Piece or anime. Some scenes were predictable but it was fine I didn't had a problem and loved how each episode had its own story to a certain character.

2023-09-03,"Mixed feelings. I only recently started watching the anime so the material this series covers, is still fresh in my mind. They've not completely butchered the anime, like most live action anime adaptations tend to, but they've still heavily missed the mark in places. The charm and silliness of the anime has largely been lost and replaced with dark, serious moments, as though the writers thought ""surely nobody would like a series that's almost entirely fun and silly and bright?"". Changing the formula that made One Piece so successful seems silly to me. Some of the acting is quite bad, at times, and one or two of the casting choices seem rather off (E.g. Zoro. Great in the action scenes but supremely un-Zoro like the rest of the time). I'll be surprised if this show creates many *new* One Piece fans. And as a budding fan of the anime, myself, this series isn't doing much for me either.",0.9908,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

It made me smile, it made me laugh and it even made me cry. If I were to score it out of 10 then it would get a 7/10. The cast were all pretty much good with the main five Straw Hat crew .

With only 8 episodes to cover vast chapters and episodes from the manga and anime, this adaptation manages to keep the spirit and message of the series in a logical and fresh way. Current fans will appreciate the nod of familiar scenes and themes taken from the source material while also experiencing the story in a new way as well.

2023-09-03,"While it's not perfect, One Piece manages to capture the magic of the anime and manga while still feeling new and fresh. How they managed to adapt what should be one the seemingly least adaptable Japanese properties and make it this coherent and solid is pretty amazing. The lack of current day politics, forced DEI, or shoddy educational moments is so refreshing and the show still manages to have a great message, a diverse and likable cast and delivers on making me feel like a kid again. The writing blows away other recent anime adoptations and sticks incredibly close to the source material. There are some unfortunate cuts and so.e very cheesy moments. For parents, there is some brief male nudity (a butt shot), child abuse, language, drinking and smoking as well as some blood and gore to accompany the violent fight scenes.

As someone who's been reading One Piece religiously for the last 18 years, I can't help but feel great pride that against all odds, One Piece was the show that finally broke the Hollywood anime => live action curse. There was so many things that could have gone wrong, yet they managed to strike the perfect balance of goofiness, seriousness, humour, action and emotion. With its outstanding acting and casting (Nami and Buggy performances really stood out to me), epic soundtrack, fantastic set and costume design (The Baratie was an absolute treat, and all the costumes felt like real clothes), amazing choreographies and solid visual effects (Zoro swords fights were incredible), both fans and newcomers will have the absolute best time watching these 8 episodes and (re)discovering the East Blue saga, and will crave more.

I'd go so far as to say they did me one better and improved the pacing , things move fast. While I was skeptical it could work as a live action, they used their budget well. It's not ""perfect"", and its less kid friendly then the original (though the original I feel was always meant more for teenagers and older as well), but given the surrealism of the source material this surpassed my expectations. Love the acting and actor choices, the Luffy actor in particular does a great job of toeing that line between annoyingly naive/optimistic, and just really good spirited/hopeful which is so important given how much screen time Luffy has to have. It has the heart of the show, and because of that I can over look some of the rougher points. All in all, no idea if I'd have liked it if I wasn't a fan of the books, but I am, and I do love this. For what its worth, my wife has said she's also enjoying it, and she did NOT like the books/anime, so its been really great to finally have her experience this series with me beyond the earliest chapters before she tapped out.",0.9967,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-03,"Whilst not capturing every detail from the Manga and anime, this Netflix Live action manages to delicately balance elements of live action story telling and ensuring main plot points of the East Blue Saga were told. No complaints at all. Best parts - Zorro, Mackenyu totally did justice to the Character. Worst parts - No Hachi, no Hachi vs Zorro. Ultimately ommiting this character may pose problems for future arcs especially the Fishman island arc... Can't wait for Season 2!!!",0.7906,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Please let there be a season 2 and more !!",0.9767,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-02,"It was ok for the anime fans, nothing more than that. The cinematography is good in most ways, the chosen camera angles and depth though are abysmal. All scenes feel always extremely limited as a result. The whole show is always happening with 4 square meters, maybe 6 when it's generous... Makes no sense since the rumored budget was very high, I'd expect that from a low budget adaptation. The world feels extremely small overall. Fighting scenes are way too short, feels like there's no pay off for the build up. They should be MUCH longer, there's almost no action. Iconic fights are shortened to a to total of 30 seconds to a minute tops, you just can't do that to us. The Arlong final fight especially was a joke, they even cut the cuts. The trademark pool fight never happened, Luffy just stomped him easy in seconds (within 4 square meters). Literally was one of the worst fighting sequences ever made, such a let down for those 2 iconic characters and that anime fight. Acting was subpar for the most part. Best of the bunch were Coby and Arlong. Arlong wasn't resembling his anime self at all though visually, which was a huge let down. Another weak point of the show, you can't have Usop having a smaller nose than Luffy... On the positives, there were some nice fighting scenes, very few and apart unfortunately. Only potential but no juice. The ""nakama"" heart of the show was there, even though poorly depicted mostly. The camera colors/filters they chose to go with were stellar, some frames really were out of the anime, the bounty animations were awesome and smart. Overall very lackluster season, seems very low budget and limited. Wants to do something and it's there, but it's not all the way (not even half way) and falls apart. I watched it as an old fan of One Piece, will watch if another season comes out. I ain't watching it because it is a great show though... ""Meh"" describes it well for a 2/5.",0.9601,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-02,"I think that Netflix's One Piece is one of the better, if not one of the best, anime adaptations there are. It is evident that the creators read the source material and were passionate about what they were doing. Some of the scenes can look a bit goofy, but that is to be expected when making a live-action of an anime where the main character is made of gum, and a guy can detach parts of his body and make them fly around. I think they made it look as best as it could've been. My favorite actor from this series must be Iñaki Godoy (playing Monkey D. Luffy), and I don't think they could've chosen a better actor for this character.",0.9705,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-02,"I went in with low expectations because Live Action adaptations from manga/anime have never been great. I was still disappointed with the direction they took with this show. The production and some of the sets look like they put effort into it. The acting and casting choices were really bad in my opinion. The actors don't fit their roles well and it feels amateurish at best. Writing is awful and the camera work is terrible (so many low angled shots and zoomed in too much for certain scenes). They left out some of the most iconic scenes as well which made me lose faith early on in the episodes. It could have been much better, but I'm also not surprised at how overall of a mess this was.",-0.8199,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-02,"Loved every second of it. This is how you do a live adaptation without alienating the fans of the original. This first season takes everything the original has to offer and improves on it significantly. All the little details that seem to matter very little at first but need to happen to set up future events are included even though a lot of events are moved to different times / locations to improve the pacing and make the story even more coherent. A long time fan of the series like me will get rewarded with many little easter eggs spread over all 8 episodes which makes this just so rewarding to watch and even rewatch multiple times. Meanwhile I feel like a newcomer gets a very good introduction into the world and its rules. Netflix took quite a risk with this as it both stayed very close to the goofyness of the original while still trying to make it interesting to more adult audiences. I don't think I've seen anything like this yet. They somehow managed to make everyone look like they do in the original without making anyone look out of place. I have no idea how they did it. And I applaud them for it. If they continue on this path, this might very well become one of the biggest franchises on their platform. Sound effects and Music is also extremely well done. The music for the most part is completely new and fresh while you sometimes hear some undertones mixed in from the original which just makes this so nostalgic. Really the only thing that bothered me was the weird teaser that was played at the end of the first episode which spoils way too much. As if the episode wasn't good enough on its own to keep people hooked for the second one.",0.995,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

It turned out to be like Nami got a full 10 but Nojiko took a 5. Nah. And the zipline is slinging, floating away. Haven't you seen the movie in the theater? How do they hang so they don't look like they're hanging? The broken sword scene is more like It's like pressing a button to release a magnet. And then it slowly fell apart. Can you use CG and have the sword shatter like in Anime? Makino bars are, oh my, just like Som Tam restaurants on the roadside in my country. There was no blood in the scene where Zoro was slashed by Mihawk. But there is a head to receive the prize. Coby has more roles, Nami, how did you show up at the Morgan base? She had to show up at Buggy's group, right? And the most frustrating thing is the ""fight scene"", you can use the stunt, it will look serious. It will be like fighting with a sword.

2023-09-02,"I've had an incredible experience with the One Piece Live Action adaptation. Watching it in the original Japanese with the returning voice cast from the anime added an authentic touch to the series. I'm excited to rewatch it in English for a fresh perspective. What sets this adaptation apart is its balance between loyalty to the source material and making necessary changes for the live-action format. Unlike some adaptations that lose the essence of the original, this one maintains the core concepts of One Piece while crafting a unique experience. I'm happy it has ""too much original source"" Iñaki Godoy deserves special recognition for his portrayal of Luffy. His performance truly brings the beloved character to life, capturing his optimism, seriousness, and fun-loving nature. Emily Rudd's dedication to Nami is evident in her acting, and she seamlessly embodies the character's personality, from her fighting skills to her thieving antics. Mackenyu's portrayal of Zoro is spot-on, delivering the right blend of seriousness and playful humor. Jacob Romero excels as Usopp, even without the long nose, nailing his storytelling and body language. The entire cast shines, and their chemistry is evident on screen. This live-action adaptation is a testament to the dedication of everyone involved. Having Eiichiro Oda, the manga creator, on board was a brilliant move, and it's clear that his influence added depth to the series. I appreciate that the creators didn't compromise the integrity of One Piece for the adaptation. Despite minor deviations, the essence remains intact. This, to me, is the best anime-to-live-action adaptation to date, and I'm thrilled with the outcome. I commend the efforts of Matt Owens and others who maintained a balance of seriousness while consulting Oda for authenticity. In my book, this adaptation deserves an 8.5 out of 10—truly impressive!",0.9946,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Undeniably, One piece is the best live action adaptation of all time. That goes to show that no matter what medium it is, One piece will reign supreme with it's exceptional story, characters and world building. Shout out to the creators of Netflix show Matt Owens and Steve Maeda for providing an intricate balance to the absurd nature of this show and making it realistic. Adding a few more subplots like Garp and Luffy's relationship is pretty interesting and adds a touch of freshness which all fans can enjoy. The cast is amazing and they hit the right note everytime! I watched this show with fans and non fans and everyone was laughing, smiling and crying. The magic of One piece is undeniable people, and I guess this live adaptation has succeeded in Oda's goal and vision - to put out One piece to the rest of the world who don't watch anime or never gave one piece a chance because of its monumental list of episodes.",0.9844,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-02,"One Piece is already better than many other live action anime adaptations but falls short when it comes to capturing the same exciting spirit of its original source. This season started off strong with the introduction of Roger and his legendary treasure. I was really impressed and excited. We get to see a lot of imagery from the anime that looked great. The pacing was on par with the anime but the scoring and soundtrack were a little disappointing and stale. The differences in storyline were mostly sensible with some exceptions. Casting choices for returning characters are amazing. Dialogue was mostly decent. Set design was great! Hair and makeup looked like a struggle. Fight scenes were pretty cool. Over all, I liked it. There's a lot of promise and hope that future seasons (if allowed) will be even better! I'm just a little unconvinced about the need to have the map to the grand line and a bit disenchanted by the lack of connection to the villagers and people of the islands that the straw hats happened to liberate. They are quite literally props with no real emotional engagement. I wanted to feel connected to Nami's village at least, but it just didn't happen. The backstory for Zoro, Sanji and Nami were basically the same but it just wasn't executed with the same conviction and emotion as the anime. I am curious to know how someone who has never read the manga or watched the anime received those bits. Maybe it was better received for someone who doesn't have anything to compare it to. Anyways, this was a pretty solid start. I hope they get a chance to continue.",0.9976,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-02,"It's not perfect. I have plenty of gripes whenever I compare it to the anime but as it is? It's very entertaining! The things they added in more than make up for the changes.

2023-09-02,"I've always heard my friends talk about One Piece, a live-action series based on a Japanese manga, the premise sounded intriguing: a young pirate named Monkey D Luffy sets out to find the legendary treasure One Piece and become the King of the Pirates, along with his diverse and loyal crew. I decided to give it a try, and I was hooked from the first episode. The show is a mix of comedy, drama, action, and adventure, with a lot of creativity and imagination. The world of One Piece is full of colorful and quirky characters, such as Buggy the Clown, a pirate who can detach his body parts; Captain Kuro, a former pirate who faked his death and became a butler; Arlong, a fish-man who rules over a village with an iron fist; and many more. Each episode introduces a new challenge or enemy for Luffy and his crew to overcome, as they travel from one island to another in search of clues and allies. The cast is amazing, especially Iñaki Godoy as Luffy, the main protagonist. He portrays Luffy's personality perfectly: he is cheerful, optimistic, fearless, and loyal to his friends. He also has a unique ability: he can stretch his body like rubber, thanks to eating a mysterious fruit when he was a child. This gives him an edge in combat, but also makes him vulnerable to sharp objects and water. Emily Rudd as Nami, the navigator of Luffy's ship, is also great. She is smart, cunning, and resourceful, but also has a tragic past that makes her sympathetic. She joins Luffy's crew after he helps her free her village from Arlong's tyranny. Mackenyu as Zoro, the swordsman of Luffy's crew, is also impressive. He is a master of the three-sword style, wielding one sword in each hand and one in his mouth. He is fierce and determined, but also has a soft spot for his friends. The show also has amazing visuals and effects. The costumes and sets are faithful to the manga style, creating a vibrant and whimsical atmosphere. The CGI effects are mostly well-done, especially when Luffy uses his stretching powers or when the characters encounter exotic creatures or phenomena. The action scenes are thrilling and well-choreographed, showcasing the skills and abilities of each character. The show is not without flaws, though. Some of the episodes feel rushed or simplified, leaving out some details or explanations that might be important for the plot or the character development. Some of the dialogue is cheesy or clichéd, relying on common tropes or jokes that might not appeal to everyone. Some of the actors seem to overact or underact in some scenes, creating an inconsistent tone. The show also ends on a cliffhanger that leaves many questions unanswered and many characters unexplored. Overall, though, I think One Piece TV series on Netflix is a fun and entertaining show that anyone can enjoy. It has a lot of humor, heart, action, and adventure that will keep you engaged and curious. I give it 4.5 stars out of 5. I hope Netflix will renew it for a second season soon.",0.9988,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-02,"After years of horrendous, disrespectful and lazy live-action anime adaptations, One Piece completely shatters the curse. It is THAT good. I had always remained hopeful that One Piece could be the show to end the cycle, but truly this show exceeded any expectations I had. Let me get this out of the way first; as with any adaptation, there will be some changes here and there. HOWEVER, none of these broke any immersion, or lingered too long or too short. Knowing that Oda was behind the decision-making for these changes makes them easy to forgive as well, as many were ideas and concepts he wanted in the manga/anime originally. Everything about this show just made me smile from ear to ear. The dedication to the characters, story, and world of One Piece is very clear, and it genuinely feels like each actor honors their character in brilliant ways, and truly these characters seem to leap off the manga pages. What's amazing is that this show not only honors Oda, and his world, but it honors the fans as well - there are so many little hidden details that come directly from certain chapters in the manga, it was really cool to see. Whether you're a fan, or just beginning your voyage, One Piece is a delight, and I would highly recommend it.",0.9966,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-02,"Here is my honest and detailed review as a fan of the anime… it is very difficult to make a live action show, because animation allows for a writer to show fantastical images, largely bolstered by the viewers imagination, without being limited by reality. A live action, by definition, is missing the very thing that made the animation so magical. The job of making a one piece live action was hard enough, but it didn't help that the creator probably was not a fan of the series. It shows in the details, here is a good example; ""My treasure is yours, I left it all in ONE PIECE."" Gol D. Rogers famous last words, a famous double entendre and the name of the show itself. In this live action, he doesn't say this, he just says ""I left it all for you."" Within the first few minutes of this live action, my heart dropped. Also, in the animation, the large smiles are charming, in live action seeing people smile so much is almost creepy and unnatural. The pacing was off, the fights are weird, this is one piece in name alone. This tv show is like beyond Meat, it's a cheap imitation of something that was a lot better. And it lacks any charm or identity to make it worth watching by itself. If you like the anime, watch the anime, if your love for the anime is why you are watching this, you will be disappointed.",0.9882,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-02,I was not expecting One Piece to be half as good as it is. The cast have great chemistry. The soundtrack is excellent. The pacing and dialogue are solid. The cinematography could be more inventive to suit the story and tone. Inoy really really shines as Luffy he brings so much exuberance and joy to the role that it will make you smile. He achieves completely selling the kind of naive heroism that is typical of Shonen with charm to spare.,0.9709,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-02,"As a passionate fan of the One Piece anime and manga series, I had high expectations for the new live-action. And I must say that the result met those expectations and far exceeded them! The live-action of One Piece is a masterpiece in the adaptation of the acclaimed series by Eiichiro Oda. The story remains faithful to the original manga but also adds some unexpected twists that keep the plot fresh even for the most die-hard fans and surprise by giving it a more Western style in some cases. The cast deserves special recognition, as each actor is immersed in their role. In particular, the actors playing the main characters, gosh, they exceeded my expectations in every way, they acted with feeling and brought to life the characters I've been following since I was 14 years old! (I am 32) Thank you all for this amazing live-action series.",0.9864,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-02,"Muito bom, so acho que focou demais no coby e trouxe ele muito cedo, sem nem ter tido um avanço mínimo sequer, e também a serie deixou de lado algumas lutas interessantes do mangá como a do don krieg(não lembro se é assim que escreve), apenas para reduzir a quantidade de episódios, fiquei bem receioso no início, mais a série é ótima, uma nova versão, Perfeita.",-0.5267,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-02,"""Netflix's One Piece live-action series takes on the monumental task of adapting one of the most beloved manga and anime franchises, and against all odds, it triumphs. Covering the arcs up to Arlong Park, the show captures the essence of Eiichiro Oda's world. While nothing can truly replicate the original, this adaptation comes close, with nuanced performances, especially Tony Dalton's Arlong, who is terrifying yet oddly charismatic. As a die-hard fan, I found myself entertained throughout all 8 episodes. The humor, action, and emotional moments are well-balanced, capturing the high seas adventure and camaraderie that make One Piece legendary. It's a joyful romp that pays homage while carving its own path. Buckle up for this seafaring journey; you won't want it to end!""",0.9409,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

You can really tell the team behind this did their research. It my not 1 to 1 identical and they change some stuff but it still comes out fantastic. The characters are really well cast especially Zoro and Luffy, and they have great chemistry. And the action scenes are really well done it really impressed me for a Netflix show. although some of the cgi while most of the time it was good to great there where a couple times it wasnt great, but it was waaaaay better than i was expecting. Anyway 100% recommend this show, hopefully now Netflix and other places see this as the minimum bar when i comes to anime to live action adaptations, i mean this destroys they Cowboy Beebop adaptation by a landslide.

2023-09-02,"It was amazing. It's super hard to capture the aesthetics and the overall vibes of an anime and translate it into a live action. But the guys pulled it off. Big Win. They had to change the way the story was played out since some stuff would be corny af in the adaptation. So the opla was kind of its own thing. If you'd seen the anime you won't feel spoiled. And if u watch the anime after the opla, u still won't feel spoiled, that's how much different the presentation was. But it's worth it.",0.9169,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

On point casting, passion for details, fresh way to tell the story, beautiful sets and filming, humor on point, captured the core of the show and the characters and made me laugh and cry without one minute of feeling bored. Music was great as well. On my rewatch already and hope a season 2 will come fast. It is One Piece but it is also its own thing. Perfect addition to expand the universe of my favorite pirate story!

2023-09-02,"There were many worries in me about this adaptation, and while there were many changes from the source material, I can't thank enough the crew working on this for making me feel for this wonderful adventure again. A lot of people will say it's not like the manga counterpart, but I couldn't care less, the changes they made were 100% logical and respectful of the source material, and that at it's core is what a live action is all about. This is a must-watch for fans, and I believe that people who have never watched one piece can also find treasure in this version without ever experiencing the original. I am thrilled and hopeful that a second season is on the way as I am now giddy in anticipation to see what happens next (even tho I know what happens as a manga reader, I found myself being surprised multiple times throughout the first season and I know that season 2 will have me even more surprised).

Fans can identify characters to great extent by their clothing, makeup, behavior, role, and actions, even for many minor anonymous background characters. There is passion conveyed and respect to the original. Of course, a live action cannot fully display many things from manga/anime like the comical over-exagerated expressions seen in manga/anime (specially in the case of One Piece), but it does add its own. They also have to speed up the story, as they have to convey around 50+ anime episodes into 8 1-hour long episodes.",0.8381,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Somit war ich also auch sehr gespannt und war restlos begeistert! Diese ersten 8 Folgen sind super gelungen! Klar wurde die Story ein wenig verändert, manches weggelassen und gestrafft, das tut der Geschichte und den Charakteren aber absolut keinen Abbruch. Ganz im Gegenteil! Es ist witzig, traurig, spannend; ich weinte vor Rührung und lachte vor Amusement gleichzeitig :-). Das muss eine Serie erstmal schaffen!

Garp would never send off Luffy, it is against the marine code. Garp never hunted Luffy from start. Buggy never met Arlong face to face. Cocoyashi's villagers all have known from the start that Nami have been stealing money for them. They missed a few keypoints in the story, shorten it maybe to save budget cause it would to a lot more episodes just to reach Arlong's arc, making the storyline less dramatic and less meaningful.

Yes, they did and yet, it worked out. Obviously there are limits to adapting an anime and the amount of content they had to cram in, so 1-1 is impossible but the details they added were a nice touch. They absolutely did a good job on the cast, costume and cg was decent. There is always room for improvement and hopefully season 2 will have it.",0.9678,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Like my expectations weren't super high, but not only did this remake exceed my expectations but even recreated the same sense of excitement and adventure as the original series did. Even apart from the original content it is literally just fun to watch in general. There are some distinct differences, but none of them too wild or crazy and it never feels like it betrays the original content. I would have given a full 5 stars if Zoro hadn't been so incredibly, needlessly edgy. I do however love everything that they've done with Nami's character and I even love her more than the original Nami to be completely honest. Anyway great show, great cast, Oda is a genius and it shows through in this live-action remake just as it does in the manga and anime.",0.9936,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-01,"Positives: I personally really liked the show overall. They absolutely nailed the impossible. The heart, charm, goofiness, spirit, and tone of the original is totally there, making it a really good adaptation. But simultaneously, it also feels like a good TV show by itself.. with great cinematography, writing, sets, dialogue, characters, plot, characters and many more. It's not perfect but they can iron things out in subsequent seasons.. as they've nailed the most important things of it pretty well. There were few changes which slightly degraded the already great experience of the live action... But majority of the changes are just recombining and modifying the plot to give similar versions of the character moments with the main crew without compromise by changing the sequence of events or combining events or restructuring them to fit a faster paced narrative without losing the character moments and growth of the main crew. Many other changes are actually based on future events or past events revealed far later in the anime... Which flesh out a lot of other things in the world and those changes also make sense. Episode 6.. The entire stretch of post zoro-Mihawk plot and the theme of being a captain taking tough decisions... and Sanji's backstory were the 10/10. The entire sequence of Zoro in well- flashback .. was also really really well done 10/10 Ep 2 of Buggy is also great.. Buggy literally stole the show. Coby and Helmeppo had the best performances for side characters. Strawhats are all great...but wanted to see more emphasis on Ussop.. Zoro-Sanji dynamic was great. The subtle gags on Zoro were chef's kiss. I ended up liking Garp by the end... Only in episode 8 we'll understand they actually didn't deviate much for Garp's character... And in fact it was pretty much loyal to the Garp's character in the manga. Arlong is actually intimidating in the show, unlike the trailers and intial doubts. ---------- There are very few negatives compared to all the great things this show got right..! Negatives: I wish the backstories are Little more fleshed out l, just 5 min extra per episode would've done wonders. Or cutting CobyMeppo B plot a little to accommodate and flesh out the backstories and the supporting characters like Genzo, Nojiko... My main issue was Nami's backstory could've been lot better if only it was 2-3 min longer. And they really did bad with Nojiko and Gen san's character by making them n villagers unaware of the truth. Nami in denial and desperation accepting that she'll do it all again to protect everyone and then Gen san consoling her... Then the help me... That sequence in animanga was powerful. I donno why they had to change the fact that Nojiko and Gen san were aware of the truth. This is my only main issue. Otherwise it's near perfect for what it's trying to be..as an adaptation and a TV show.",0.9988,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-01,"Bigger spoilers ahead: While much better than Netflix's other attempts at anime adaptation, this one made a lot of mistakes. Stupid camera angles and lenses. Hokey music with ""piratey"" fifes and crap (why?!), and the original theme song (a true gem that never gets old) was only referenced twice in an overly serious arrangement; almost sapping the fun out of the tune itself. Boo. I do not have any problems with casting! I like all the actors, even all the straw hats. I think they actually fixed Sanji here, so that he's not a complete freaking perv, but that's where a lot of the comedy came from, and because Zoro here is just sooooooooo serious all the time (Zoro is much more dynamic in the source material) there is hardly any comedy to speak of. Nami is portrayed well by a good actor and without misogamy, but without her more bubbly side, she is not as dynamic either. So serious. Ussop is great, less annoying, BUT his character development was greatly cheapened in the adaptation in a crucial way! I'll get to that in a second. And Luffy. I want to state that anyone trying to play this character will disappoint fans. It doesn't matter if they don't smile big like an insane rubber crackhead, or if they have an accent or not, it's because they simply don't have Mayumi Tanaka's voice. NOBODY will ever be more Luffy than Mayumi Tanaka. For 14 years her voice has made us smile, laugh, cry, and think big thoughts about how we should treat people and ourselves. So, this kid is going to disappoint and that's nobody's fault. But he does an amazing job of it. He's charismatic, optimistic, determined, and protective of his nakama. But I do think he portrays a Luffy who is too smart, experiencing too much self doubt, and who is too weak while being too stoic. I like that he focused on creating someone who is 100% concerned with goodness and dreams and smiled a lot, and also listens a lot. Luffy listens to people when it counts. So I hope that folks who haven't seen the anime can appreciate his hard work and talent more than I can, because it's just so hard not to be distracted by how different Luffy is here. As for Ussop, I like the actor a lot. I think he's dynamic and portrays a less annoying Ussop, though much less funny. One of the biggest problems with this adaptation was how they crammed Arlong Park into one episode, and one thing that suffered from that was Ussop's development. He is supposed to be a coward. He is supposed to get chased down by Chew, beaten to hell and feel ashamed of how weak he is, how useless to his friends he is. He is supposed to push past that fear and doubt and shame and DEFEAT a much much stronger opponent regardless of how implausible it is. And at the end of it, he screams from the flat of his back that he can win fights! Not to look down on him. He proves his worth to his opponent and himself. And we, the reader/watcher, are feeling a kind of payoff here like it was a letter from Oda to all the outcasts and freaks out there who feel totally unequipped to be of use, totally unworthy of friendship and love. That we too can do it. We can win, we can help our friends. This adaptation shortened the fight to a few minutes, removed ALL of the pain and danger from it, the comedy, and when Ussop delivers his victory line, he's standing unharmed, and he says something that vaguely resembles what Oda wrote, but twisted into another one of Ussop's stupid lies, only showing us that even when nobody's watching his ego needs to be fed. I think this is the wrong way to portray Ussop. Similarly to Ussop's fight, Luffy's fight with Arlong was shortened a bunch, sanitized of almost any pain or danger whatsoever, and showed a much less creative couple of combatants. Much, much less creative. Part of that is because in the source material Luffy and Arlong are much closer to being equals in physical might, so things get funky and wild. But here? Luffy is much weaker than Arlong so he tricks him into destroying his own home, and the collapse kills Arlong, the stronger one, but not Luffy, the weaker one? Really? And no biting? No nose break? No dagger dentures? What? This is supposed to be a fantastically unrealistic story. You're supposed to barely see Luffy's fists coming. He's supposed to be an insane dude obsessed with fighting. If they did away with the unneeded Garp beat down, they could have spent more time on Arlong Park and done it justice, but they instead made it boring and weird. Sanji/kuroobi, and zoro/hachi fights were criminally re-written, a 1/10 compared to the anime. Arlong realizing how dangerous Zoro is was one of the cooler parts of the fight in the source material. Seeing the kind of insane willpower Zoro has to remain alive and useful even after receiving what Arlong thinks is a mortal wound from Mihawk. Resolving to kill him then and there because Zoro poses such a threat to him if he were to heal and continue living. And not to mention.... hey.....NO ""SWITCH!?!?!"" What the heck! No switch?!?!?! That whole piece is missing!? This whole thing was too grounded, too short, and too serious, though the visual effects were great. There is nothing wrong with the casting or anyone's accents, genders, or race. The One Piece world does not exist, so....whatever. Don't cry about how many extra's weren't white or whatever. If you ask me, I'm excited to see how season 2 continues to fix Zoro's seeming racial bias that one could point out in the anime at times. And I'm also grateful that the adaptation is much less likely to obsess over titties as much as the source material does down the line, but, what the adaptation can possibly ""fix"" with the anime may not be enough to win Netflix any more stars from me based on how much it got wrong and/or simply didn't bother to include. The series needed a minimum of one more episode, preferably two to be done better. Netflix...! Arlong Park is an epic conclusion to the biggest arc in the series up that point.

2023-09-01,"Well, to start, the series is truly impressive. It stands as the finest anime adaptation ever created. Although I found some of the initial alterations from the original work to the live-action screen a bit odd in the first episodes, I soon realized that it's an entirely unique experience. While staying faithful to the original script, it incorporates its own changes to align with the pacing and more ""realistic"" choices of One Piece. I came to the conclusion that I adored the series when I found myself longing for more after it had already concluded. The first season adeptly introduces all the Straw Hat characters, even though Sanji and Usopp were granted less screen time, which is understandable since they joined the story later on! The actors skillfully convey the emotions they intend to evoke, and I enjoyed every aspect of it! Despite Luffy's excessive laughter, haha, he can be charismatic without constantly wearing a smile. That aspect was slightly exaggerated, but not to the extent that it warrants dismissal 😅 A few camera angles weren't the most optimal; they deviated from the norm. The fight scenes, I must declare, were nothing short of epic! While typically seeming staged, these appeared as if they were genuinely engaging in real-time combat. The effects, sounds, weaponry, and abilities were exceptionally well-executed. The rubber fruit and chop-chop abilities were especially masterfully portrayed!!!!

2023-09-01,"I had every reason to believe that Netflix's One Piece adaptation would be a collosal piece of garbage. They have done nothing but give me reason after reason with their awful takes on Cowboy Bebop, and the Witcher to not trust them to do an adaptation properly, and just when I was completely done with them they pull off One Piece. It makes no sense, but this is the wild and crazy world we live in. Now granted, One Piece is actually impossible to adapt COMPLETELY to the live screen, anyone even casually familiar with the source material will understand that, but goddamn this show does as good of a job as can be reasonably expected to bring the world and characters to life. The casting is great. These might be relatively newcomer actors, but they give the kinds of performances that make it look like they have been waiting their entire lives to bring these characters to life. Iñaki Godoy in particular gets a standing ovation from me for how close he nailed Luffy. We get actual sets and make up and not just an overabundance of CGI which is a nice thing to see. The writing and directing does an admirable job of not only adjusting the pace to make it fit in live action, which any One Piece fan could tell you was going to be a challenge, but also not shying away from the original style of the manga. There's a side by side comparison of one of the fights in the series, I wont say which one to keep this review spoiler free, that shows just how closely the choreography was being tailored to fit the action in the anime. I do still have some nitpicks about certain adjustments that don't seem to be neccessary but they're not major gripes as much as minor nitpicks. All of my praise being said, this show still might not click for everyone. The subject matter is goofy and kind of cheesy at times, but hey it wouldn't be One Piece if it wasn't. I have to give Netflix my genuine appreciation for this one. They did this one right. I'm quick to tell them when they screw things up, (just read my Witcher review) so it's only fair I praise them when they get it right.",0.9927,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-01,"I went in thinking this was going to be another poor attempt at adapting a widely beloved animated series into live action. I was wrong. The diversity of the actors on the show really helped to sell you on how massive the OP world is. With different accents and cultures at the forefront to show how vastly different islands are to one another. The soundtrack is amazing. The fighting choreography is what I was most impressed with. Many times in these shows the fighting comes off as clunky, but there were smooth transitions throughout showcasing the different fighting styles of each character.

2023-09-01,"I have seen 1 episode and from that I hear it only gets worse, all important scenes seemingly shot in the dark, clunky dialouges, forced character relationships, rushed story and not to mention poor changes made to speed up the story. This looks and feels like a show for toddlers but since it has blood, people throwing up the bird and swearing it cant be. This show is even more childish in general then the Anime or the manga. The show lacks so many things the Anime has, even though some fans claim this to be closer to the Manga than the anime. It seems Netflix has stumbled on magic word that will help them manipulate and bait fans to watch it. It being: ""[Insert Creator] approved of this"". With this as tool to manipulate fans into not calling the creator into question for bad adaptation they will have free reigns now to go ahead and bastardize more Anime's, books and comics. This show is on par in quality, depth and storyline as Cowboy Bebop and Deathnote which both famously angered people, but alas they did not have the magic word to throw an illusion spell over it. Now only time will tell if the rating of the show from audiences goes up or down, weird how some shows/movies that are controversial dont seem to move in ratings for some period of time.",-0.9163,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-01,"It's a dream come true to see the greatest epic come to life. The chances they take are acceptable and they keep a close to source material as possible. The actors are the real life characters from top to bottom. The fight scenes are, surprisingly to me, choreographed excellently and action packed. I'd also dare to say that the character ""Zoro"" was introduced to our MC was better than how it's done from the source material. A gripe of mine is a few choice decisions to add or remove what I deemed to be pivotal dialog that gave me, when I first discovered the series, better in depth insight to our characters. I can get over the very small misses with everything else great that come with the live action. Congratulations anime fans, we finally got a live action adaption right! Here's to hoping we get more seasons, episodes and I pray, more budget in the future of this series.

I was sceptical about how the action sequences will get translated but they did a surprisingly amazing job. It's easier for a non anime fan to appreciate this series as an adventure series but harder for an anime fan to approve it.

2023-09-01,"I think it was an extremely hard task to do a live action of such a goofy anime that is One Piece which seems completely unadapted to that format. And it did a surprisingly good job, I expected to be disappointed but ended up bingewatching all of it. It's not perfect (could it really be) but I've been attached to the characters, liked the way they focused on Garp and Koby, the way they portrayed Zoro, the banter between the crew, Nami and Buggy were really so so well played. Yeah it still feels a bit weird at some points (it's one piece after all) but I kinda wanna see more of it (?) It's really watchable, from a one piece fan point of view. I'm not sure how good is it if you don't know the OP universe at all though, but I don't think it'd be that bad. Luffy is interesting, he's not exactly the same as manga Luffy, yet he definitely has that goofy vibe. He's.. smarter and less confident (and less overpowered ?^^) in the live action though I'd say, which is.. fine as well, I liked him anyway. Same can be said to Garp who is kind of different but I still liked. So it's One piece without really being one piece (yet surprisingly faithful to the manga at times), but overall I enjoyed my time",0.9929,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-01,"Actually the best live action anime adaptation to date. I have been a One Piece fan for almost 20 years (most of my life), and they got everything right. The characters in my opinion look and act perfect. Instead of the weird proportions or the slightly wonky art style they look like real people. Not cosplayers trying to make themselves into hyper realistic anime characters. I love the creative freedoms and liberties they took. Including more Garp, Koby, Helmeppo, and Buggy was wonderful. And the pacing fixed a lot if what people find wrong with One Piece in anime form. Sprinkling in details that are seen or talked about later in the show is a wonderful tie in as well. All in all I really hope we get more Live Action One Piece.",0.9863,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-01,"It's been a cliché for years now that an anime is always a flop when turned into a live-action series or movie. There has been a few exceptions, but mostly it's been true. After watching the eight episodes back-to-back, also having in my memories the images of the anime that I started watching 17 years ago, I was reliving that first watch as the story is as close as it can get from the anime. Yes, there are some differences because of the format, the storytelling and the pacing, but the essence of it is all there. The actors really grasp their characters. I recognize each character as they are in the anime. Luffy is not as dumb as he is normally, but he still has that simple innocence to him. Zoro still does not have any sense of direction. And so on with the others. Maybe I'm biased because I was a fan of the anime at first, but I really thing it is a really good TV show. For someone that never heard or seen the anime, it could be weird to see all those hair styles and colors, a man with an axe for a hand or another one with two four-bladed gloves that can move really fast or even a clown that can... well... you'll see. To those people, I just want to ask you to volontarily suspend your disbelief and enjoy a great tale of friendship, dreams and piracy!",0.9913,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-01,"One Piece Live Action Series has adapted the Manga/Anime quite well, although there were few things missing which I had have loved to see if they had included those minute details as well, but at the same time, there were many scenes which I thought came out better here even more than the Manga/Anime, and it was so much fun to experience the journey in a new form with a bit different plot and execution. I wouldn't have liked it as much if it was all the same with it being just an imitation of the original source, the manga/anime, and then there would have also been so many scenes from the chapters/episodes of the manga left out due to it being just 8 episodes long season. Then, the plot wouldn't have made much sense to a non-one-piece-manga/anime fan if they had followed the manga/anime one to one. The things that could be better in season 2 are the CGI and an increase in number of episodes to make the flow of the scenes even better(they should increase it to 10 episodes per season for a 1000+ chapter long series).",0.9774,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

The actors are great. perfect casting. 5 stars for Emily, she knows Nami well and gives the character justice. 4.5 For Mackenyu, his sword skills are the coolest part of the show. 4.2 for Inaki, is fluffy, funny, cheerful, and scary especially in the last episode. 4 for both Jacob and Taz. Buggy actor is 5+ stars, his acting is considered one of the best depictions of fictional psycho clowns. VFX can be better. The fighting is short, 80 minutes per episode would have been the best just to give us more fights. but the choreography is creative. wish could've seen more. dialogues, some didn't landed-cringe I might say. For an anime that has too many episodes, I'm okay with it being fast-paced but sometimes forget to slow down. luffy is creative in fighting by using his devil fruit, sadly it didn't translate well.

2023-09-01,"True to its manga origins, and filmed in homage to the style of the anime, ""One Piece"" does a wonderful job of recreating what is one of Japan's most historic and ingenious works of fiction. The show has a youthful charm, is appropriately silly and is extremely ""Woke"", but can be forgiven for the later, due to the respect it gives its roots. It's extremely rare to see media stay true to form, as producers, directors and the requirements of filming often interfere with any authenticity a story might have as filming progresses. The small deviations this show does take are done in such good taste, that it can even be argued that they improve the story. It's difficult to ask this show to reproduce the frenetic fight scenes and rapid pace of its predecessor, the Japanese anime. To do so would require a higher bar in terms of emotional performance as well as action sequence. The anime presents incredibly exaggerated expressions and gestures thru creative vantage points. It's very wise of developers Matt Owens and Steven Maeda to forego these requirements in this live-action remake, allowing the series to come down to Earth, while still delivering excitement and laughter to its audience! The cinematographers do a commendable job filming, and all other aspects of the show (including script, plot and sound) are delivered professionally, even down to each line being clearly spoken. ""One Piece"" is about friendship, character, and skill. It's also about over-the-top villains and down-to-Earth protagonists. Monkey D. Luffy's infectious confidence inspires others; he searches their hearts for their one true desire, and helps them achieve it. As such, he is a true hero, despite the clingy, brown-nose style this series exaggerates in his character. Sadly, the decision to include blood and gore in this show seriously detracts from its ability to be family friendly. Despite this setback, ""One Piece"" delivers on its goofy, action-packed premise, and is a great popcorn flick / series for parties and get togethers.",0.9979,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-01,"As a diehard One Piece fan who is fully caught up with the anime and Manga, I really enjoyed this live-action rendition! Sure, it took a different direction than the source material but it does a really good job at it. The actors fit their roles, the characters are all full of life, and I could feel the same fire that One Piece lit in my heart when I first read it. And for a Netflix anime adaptation, this is absolutely wonderful! Well done to everyone in charge of making it.",0.9776,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-01,"Where to begin....... The acting was terrible, this is why some things are not meant to be live action. The worst most cringe actor was Zoro's character, he did not portray him at all. The CGI was ps3 level graphics. The story made little to no sense, and the characters did the exact opposite of what they did in the anime. The character they messed up the most was Nami. She is a sly thief, not an altruistic warrior, Luffy's acting falls flat, and is often corny and annoying. This is the WORST adaptation EVER made. It's the worst because they actually butchered the source material by getting rid of all character development through horrible pacing. Many of the events where they main characters meet never happened in the anime, by changing the way the characters meet and interact you change the entire story. Some parts are trying to be serious and dark while the very next scene is silly and awkward. The One Piece fan boys will praise this garbage.... This show has 0 redeeming qualities",-0.9775,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-01,"One Piece is my childhood memory. Netflix not only successfully recreated many classic scenes but also perfectly captured the charisma and acting skills of the actors, portraying them as the Straw Hat Pirates from my memory. It's truly moving to see characters that were once only on paper come to life in my real world.",0.8701,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-01,"The curse put upon Netflix when it comes about adapting mangas is gone. They managed to do a good rendition of a classic Shonen whiteout having a river of tears streaming from the original fans. At last, the adventure and the characters are respected, even sublimed. I am exited to see the next steps they will be taking with One Piece.",0.6369,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-01,"When I first saw the trailer, I was pretty sure it would break the curse of anime adaptations being absolutely terrible. It looks like I was right. The good parts greatly outweighed the bad parts. The acting, character dynamics, most of the CGI, the costumes, the action, the little shout outs to future arcs like Noland the liar and Jaya are some of the outstanding parts of this adaptation. Yeah sure the camera work was sometimes kind of wonky and the lines are a little corny but this isn't some HBO drama. Its one piece. The love for the original material is here and I can't wait for a season 2!",0.9269,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

Aunque es natural el que los fanáticos tengan sus opiniones mixtas, el equipo de producción ha demostrado un compromiso sobresaliente al capturar la esencia de la historia y sus personajes. La elección del elenco ha sido acertada, con actores que se esmeraron en dar vida de manera auténtica a sus respectivos personajes y roles. La calidad de producción brilla en la recreación tanto de los personajes como escenarios extravagantes y acompañado de un buen guion, enfoques sobresalientes en la direccione de cámara y en general todo lo relacionado al apartado audiovisual y escenografía, siento que esta ""Adaptación"" brinda a los fanáticos y no fanáticos, la oportunidad de vivir la serie en un nuevo formato y representa un emocionante paso hacia adelante para esta gran franquicia como para nuevos proyectos.",0.6249,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes

2023-09-01,"This is what an adaption should be! It's not trying to copy the anime, but instead, it stands on its own as a separate entity from the source material to not fit the medium in which it is being adapted better but to help people who don't enjoy manga or anime to enjoy the world built by oda. As a massive fan of the series, I am very excited to see what happens next because I don't know what's going to happen next and that's a good thing. It's like experiencing the series again but now from a different point of view due to this being a different medium. In summary, the live-action one-piece succeeded in properly adapting a manga series into a live-action TV show without losing the heart of the story.",0.9698,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-01,"Wow. Just, wow. One Piece has always been my favorite manga and anime. So I was semi worried when they announced a live action adaptation. But, well they did it, they finally did it. A good anime adaptation. When I say OPLA is good. I mean it is flippin fantastic! The sets are beautiful. The pacing is done really well. I like how each episode holds its own tone. Each of the cast does an amazing job protraying their character. Its everything I could hope for and more.

2023-09-01,"Ficou ótimo, o Luffy ficou umas caretas aqui e alí mas, está bom. O Live Action eu daria um 10/100% de aprovação mas, ele resumiram de mais, muita coisa importante ficou de fora, como a luta contra o Don Krieg, o arco do Gato podia ter deixado para depois, o Arlong aparecer no Baratie ficou estranho, a luta do Kuro, Buggy e Arlong ficaram muito curtas. No Anime e Mangá tem um peso e desenvolvimento do arco. Coisa que aqui não tem, personagens foram esquecidos como o homem polvo la do Arlong Park, ele é nó engraçado, e o Zoro derrotar ele mesmo morrendo torna melhor, o Kabaj não tem luta, o Zoro apenas faz ele desmaiar, não tem o bando dos piratas de Ussop, ou o cara esquisitão o Jango lá do Kuro que hipnotiza, tudo bem o Marry morrer, não foi de todo o mal. Os amigos do Zoro, aqueles que chamam de maninhos (foi mal eu esqueci), eles não existem também (...), os Denden-Muxis quase não vimos falar e por praticamente não ter o arco do Baratie (o que foi um pecado) não tem a melhor frase de East Blue dito pelo Perna Ruiva ""Um Homem que impunha a lança da determinação, não pode ser derrotado"". De resto está perfeito. Teria um 10/100% de nota se tivesse mais tempo, tipo 20 episódios (e olha que é pouco, já que tentaram resumir 61 episódios em 8) por isso, minha nota é um 8/80%.",-0.128,Negative,Rotten Tomatoes

Of course, we have to remember that it is an adaptation, but this series does not take away the magic and essence of One Piece, the series works well with the actors, the settings, the sets, the boats and the protagonists, as a fan of the work, I am loving it ! Bring on the 2nd season!",0.9106,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
2023-09-01,"Just finished the entire season in one sitting, and I am confident that the One Piece live adaptation might be the best manga/anime adaptation Hollywood has ever produced. It's not flawless, but it's undeniably impressive. Firstly, the set design is incredibly well-crafted, a clear testament to the creators' deep understanding of the source material. The majority of the cast delivers remarkable performances, particularly Iñaki Goday as Luffy and Mackenyu Arata as Zoro – they seem destined for these roles. The remaining crew members (Nami, Usopp, Sanji) also excel in bringing their respective characters to life, although some adjustment time might be needed. While the supporting cast performs adequately, unfortunately, Arlong – who should be the most anticipated villain in this lore – comes across as ridiculous and fails to capture the intimidating essence of his manga/anime counterpart. He stands as a prime example that not every practical makeup choice effectively portrays certain characters. Lastly, this series, which has received the approval of the original mangaka, might feel somewhat rushed. Even as someone who read the manga a while back, I noticed numerous changes and cuts that significantly deviate from the source material. However, considering they only had 8 episodes to cover the entire saga (compared to around 40 episodes in the anime, if I recall correctly), some leniency is warranted.",0.9585,Positive,Rotten Tomatoes
