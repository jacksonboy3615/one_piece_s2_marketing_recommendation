Until just now, and I'm losing i am loving the delivery of miss. All Sunday's lines, and the music is freaking amazing. I'm wondering, are we gonna get A? Rendition, of the very, very strongest. In the season cause I would love to hear it. It's so crazy that all these absurd silly powers are being translated into this awesomeness that is delive action. I ami'm absolutely loving everything about this trailer. But there is another thing I want them to start doing again before we got season. One, we got a lot of interviews with the crew like the cast and stuff, and I liked getting to know them that way. I'm really looking forward to those things. Can't wait for those to start dropping a lot more. I know we got those small interviews. But it still hasn't been the same as before season.

2026-01-12,I guess I cant watch the live series. Im following One Piece 20 years now and am 38. I have too  many cringe moments and most scenes for  me are too weak  compared to what I have seen in manga/anime  and the 20 years of imagining many scenes. This is  likely the reason why for me One Piece isnt just a piece of drawn animations and designs. I think every little detail I can be critical about. And thats why the Live action series to me are simply not up to par. Yes. From another perpective this is more than very decent.

I expected it to get negative comments, just like the Dragon Ball live-action adaptation.

I used to think that if America made a live-action film based on a Japanese anime, the result would definitely be bad, like the Dragon Ball live-action. But my assumption was completely wrong.

Vivi, and now Igaram?
Why would you purposely go out of your way to make such glaring changes to the characters which have always resulted in public backlash and commercial costs?
Why put yourself into a position by forcing your political ideology onto others at the expense of the product you're creating? One Piece deserves better and this behaviour has become so connected to bad writing that it's seriously making me question how they're going to screw it up rather than being as excited for it.

I don't know why Netflix keeps putting racism above quality content; this is one of the reasons that other netflix shows are hemorrhaging support and people are boycotting them.

2026-01-13,"Hello, just a friendly reminder to whoever you are reading this comment right now, that Jesus loves you 💛

(Romans 3:23 NIV)
for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,

yet...

(Romans 5:7‭-‬8 NIV)
Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

(John 3:16 NIV)
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

Your situation might be hard to explain right now, you don't need to fight alone because you are never alone, trust Jesus and he will fight for you, Dear Stranger, God loves you. 💛💓 keep praying and never give up.

God is always ready to pick you up where you're at, If we repent of our sins, we are not too far from God, He is Faithful and he promises to comfort us and give us peace 💛

The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
Psalms 34:18 NIV

Finally be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.

If this is as good as it looks like it's gonna be and if the show continues with that quality, I'm just gonna be sad that season 1 didnt fit in with the rest, and was so lackluster and unfaithful compared to the rest of the show. The first season would not have had things like the unluckies in it. It didnt even have hachi, which is blasphemy. And every arc was watered down and boring compared to the anime. This season actually looks like the real deal with all the goofiness, while the first season was WAY too serious.",0,0.7755,Positive,YouTube

2026-01-18,"Jesus loves you all, He died for you.  He went the most vile pain in this world . But he rose back up and now He will be returning. So please repent before it’s too late. God our gracious father has given us the best gift that can be offered in existence. It’s eternal life with him when Jesus the Lamb of God returns and a relationship with Him. He even offers more than that. All because He truly loves us. He can heal you from everything that draining and dragging you down. Everything that you struggle with; all the pain that you suffer daily and weekly. He knows what you need. He wants to heal you, you just have to let him. Trust in him and have faith that it will be done. Nothing in the is world can take away what you gone through and suffered. This world only provides temporary comfort. But Jesus can set you free from it completely and permanently. Don’t trust this world, because it will deceive and keep you in that dark place that you are in. Nothing in this world will give you peace nor heaven but only the one who created it. I would highly recommend Jesus because He’s the best thing that happened to me in my life. He is the one that I most love and put forward first. If I had to choose between every desire in this world or Jesus, I would choose Jesus because He is worthy! 1 Cross + 3 Nails= 4 Given!
