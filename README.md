One Piece Season 2: Sentiment-Led Marketing Strategy
📑 Executive Summary

The Challenge
Live-action anime adaptations historically face high levels of fan skepticism. While One Piece Season 1 successfully broke this pattern, Season 2 introduces a new challenge: onboarding a large ensemble cast (Baroque Works) without losing the momentum and goodwill built in the first season.

The Solution
This project applies a data-first marketing approach. By analyzing over one year of Season 1 audience reviews alongside immediate community reactions to the Season 2 trailer, new cast members are segmented into three actionable marketing tracks:

Revenue Generation – Identifying fan-favorite characters for merchandise prioritization

Organic Growth – Identifying “hype engines” that drive viral, social-first engagement

Brand Protection – Identifying casting-related risks to proactively mitigate negative PR

Key Results

Market Readiness: A strong Season 2 Demand Ratio confirms the audience is primed for the March 2026 launch

Top Asset: Nico Robin emerges as the highest-performing character asset, with 54% positive sentiment

Viral Catalyst: Igaram / Baroque Works generate the strongest humor-driven engagement, ideal for top-of-funnel awareness

Strategic Pivot: Current data supports de-prioritizing Vivi in early promotional materials due to active casting-related friction within the community

📌 Project Overview

Following the critical success of One Piece Season 1 (86% Rotten Tomatoes), this project uses multi-platform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to inform and optimize the marketing rollout strategy for Season 2 (launching March 10, 2026).

The analysis combines historical audience data from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes with real-time engagement signals from the Season 2 trailer to identify hype drivers, merchandise opportunities, and brand safety risks.

🎯 Project Objectives

Retrospective Analysis: Quantify a Season 2 Demand Ratio from Season 1 reviews to validate market readiness

Trailer Engagement Mapping: Measure audience reception to new characters using YouTube like-to-comment ratios and keyword frequency analysis

Strategic Categorization: Segment characters into actionable marketing pillars—Merchandise Leads, Meme Catalysts, and Risk Mitigation

📊 Key Findings

Nico Robin (Merchandise Lead): Maintains a 54% positive sentiment, positioning her as the primary candidate for high-value merchandise rollout

Igaram & Baroque Works (Meme Catalysts): Drive the strongest humor-based engagement, making them ideal for viral short-form campaigns (Reels, TikTok)

Vivi (Brand Safety Risk): Exhibits negative sentiment 50% above platform average, indicating a need to limit early high-visibility promotion until audience perception stabilizes
